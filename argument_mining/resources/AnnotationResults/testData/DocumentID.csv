606,"Our reading of §28.45 and §28.50 in the light of the Court's statements in Roth, 12 200-ft.

610,"Appellant argues that this reference to statutes ""existing"" at the time Miller was decided precludes judicial construction of statutes passed after the decision, and therefore Guam's statute, which had been passed approximately three years after Miller, is not capable of being ""saved"" by judicial construction.",{},2020-05-20 21:12:32.288499+00,2020-05-20 21:12:32.288535+00,,11

618,"The argument, however, is that the definition of obscenity under Miller is a completely separate requirement from the requirement of a specific definition of the sexual conduct being prohibited, and that any construction of the Guam statute to include the Miller specificity requirements is unconstitutional because the construction could only have been made subsequent to appellant's arrest.",{},2020-05-20 21:12:32.309672+00,2020-05-20 21:12:32.309705+00,,11

2767,"In concluding that the inquiry had never reached the accusatorial stage, the court observed that the interrogation had been confined to the subject of the whereabouts, possession and control of the defendant's automobile at the time in question; that reference by the investigators to the fact that the crime of robbery had been committed had served only to emphasize the need for, rather than the focal point of, the inquiry; and that there had been",{},2020-05-20 21:16:34.063238+00,2020-05-20 21:16:34.063255+00,,20
