The government maintains that the indictments should not be dismissed because of two off-the-record discussions in the absence of a showing as to the nature of the discussions and prejudice accruing to the appellants.,1,11.33333333,60.33333333,5.411764706,217
"The argument, however, is that the definition of obscenity under Miller is a completely separate requirement from the requirement of a specific definition of the sexual conduct being prohibited, and that any construction of the Guam statute to include the Miller specificity requirements is unconstitutional because the construction could only have been made subsequent to appellant's arrest.",1,11.4,66.2,5.894736842,392
"""So long as the statute remains available to the State the threat of prosecutions of protected expression is a real and substantial one.",0,11.5,56,4.956521739,136

"On February 5, 1976, the appellants sued the government of Guam on a cause of action alleging that the Government's failure to renew their teaching contracts was in violation of a 1972 collective bargaining agreement between the Department of Education and the Guam Federation of Teachers.",1,11.5,60,5.304347826,289

"With receipt of the above instructions, the jury was sufficiently appraised of the more restrictive burden on the government than that required by Miller.",1,12,64.5,5.458333333,154

It would seem inequitable for this court to bind defendant to the two (2) month requirement for response when due in part to clerical error by the clerk the summons was served in a defective state.,1,12,53,4.5,197

"Plaintiff contends that even if a defect were to exist in the summons, over 100 days have since elapsed and as yet defendant has not filed a response, thus inferring that any response now would be untimely.",1,12.33333333,55.66666667,4.594594595,206
