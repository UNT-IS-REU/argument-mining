The case number of the subsequent complaint filed against the defendant was not even made part of the record during the Superior Court hearing.,0,Argument
"Dated this 26th day of October, 1979.",0,Argument
The following facts were adduced at trial:,0,Argument
"On or about February 10, 1978, at approximately 1:05 p.m., a Mr. Duran of the Department of Public Safety Vice Division had gone with an Officer Sabían to the Sandy You Club in Tamuning.",0,Argument
"After entering the club, Duran and Sabían sat at a table which was located approximately ten to fifteen feet in",0,Argument
Duran attempted to photograph appellant's performance.,0,Argument
"He was prevented from doing so by one of the club's waitresses, who informed him that taking pictures in the club was not permitted.",0,Argument
The sole issue before us is whether the affidavit and the testimony given to the judge issuing the search warrant were legally sufficient.,0,Argument
"The Government's witness, Mr. Duran, admitted he did not see appellant's entire performance since he entered the Sandy You club after appellant had begun her dance.",0,Argument
"From this admittedly partially-observed performance, appellant argues that it was impossible for Duran to describe appellant's entire performance to the jury and therefore, it was impossible for the jury to determine whether the performance, as a whole, was in fact obscene.",0,Argument
The controlling community is the entire territory of Guam.,0,Argument
"The above-entitled action is a special proceedings brought before the Court on behalf of the minor child, Brenda, natural daughter of the respondent, Barbara Finona.",0,Argument
"Brenda, the minor daughter of the respondent, was represented by Alberto J.C.",0,Argument
"The petition came before this Court for hearing on February 14, 1980.",0,Argument
"As noted above, after an evidentiary hearing the trial court found as a fact that the previous buy at Rico's house 36 hours before seeking a warrant was not made under such strict supervision of the police that it provided probable cause for",0,Argument
"Brenda was born on September 7, 1979.",0,Argument
The petitioners in Marks were indicted for conduct occurring prior to the decision in Miller.,0,Argument
"Appellant first makes a broad attack on Guam Criminal and Correctional Code §28.45 and §28.50, alleging that they are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.",0,Argument
"After the child, Brenda, was born her habitual running did not cease.",0,Argument
"On September 20, 1979 based upon an application by the",0,Argument
"Department of Public Health and Social Services, a temporary removal order was made and Brenda was placed in foster care.",0,Argument
"The natural father is, however, unknown.",0,Argument
"Prior to the birth of Brenda, she (Barbara) was constantly involved in runaway proceedings and associated with stealing and burglary charges.",0,Argument
"The natural mother, Barbara, is a minor who is presently in the Department of Youth Affairs dormitory.",0,Argument
Barbara had taken her baby to the Guam International Airport and had abandoned the baby in the restroom.,0,Argument
On occasion she would leave Brenda unattended.,0,Argument
"It was on December 10, 1979 that Barbara and Brenda were missing from the caretaker's home.",0,Argument
"After the search warrant was issued, a search of Defendant’s house produced no narcotics but a firearm was found in the house.",0,Argument
"Appellee concedes that hearsay evidence may properly be considered by a magistrate in issuing a search warrant, so long as there is a substantial basis for believing the hearsay to be credible.",0,Argument
It was only after the Trial Court took additional testimony at the hearing to suppress that it found the Rico residence is located where numerous other dwelling houses were located.,0,Argument
Barbara is mentally retarded.,0,Argument
"On September 20, 1979, the petitioner, an attorney at law, was appointed by this Court to represent the interests of the said minor, Brenda.",0,Argument
Section 28.50 of the Code provides in relevant part:,0,Argument
"The Affidavit in support of the subject Search Warrant recited that ""CRI"" was known to affiant police officer to be reliable because he had made two previous buys of narcotics under affiant's supervision and control.",0,Argument
g. employs or uses a minor under the age of eighteen years to do or assist in doing any of the acts described in this section; or,0,Argument
"The Affidavit showed that in the two previous buys made by ""CRI"" under",0,Argument
Of course it is for the judge authorizing the warrant to find the facts from the evidence submitted in affidavit form.,0,Argument
"On February 5, 1976, the appellants sued the government of Guam on a cause of action alleging that the Government's failure to renew their teaching contracts was in violation of a 1972 collective bargaining agreement between the Department of Education and the Guam Federation of Teachers.",0,Argument
"Dated this 12th day of December, 1978.",0,Argument
"Unfortunately, there was some confusion at the October 25, 1975 hearing because it was only halfway through the proceedings that the Court was made to realize that the appellant had not been formally charged with the commission of another offense, i.e. by indictment or information, as required by the Code.",0,Argument
"In this appeal, appellant contends: (1) that Guam Criminal and Correctional Code §28.45 and §28.50 are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and the prosecution of the appellant thereunder violated her constitutional right to due process of law; and (2) the evidence presented against appellant was insufficient to sustain a conviction because the government failed to produce any evidence of the community standards of Guam; and (3) the evidence presented was insufficient to sustain a conviction because the jury was deprived of the opportunity to consider appellant's performance as a whole in reaching its determination as to whether or not she violated Guam's obscenity law.",0,Argument
"In other words the experience of the police with ""CRI"" was that he could be relied upon to give accurate information.",0,Argument
Duran then placed appellant under arrest.,0,Argument
A person is guilty of misdemeanor if he knowingly or recklessly:,0,Argument

"The term utterly without redeeming social value or importance, as used in these instructions, means that the alleged obscene matter must be totally devoid of any redeeming literary, scientific of artistic value or any other of social importance.",0,Argument
"In determining the question of whether the alleged obscene live conduct is utterly without redeeming social importance, you may consider the circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution or publicity, and particularly, whether such circumstances indicate that the live conduct was being commercially exploited by the defendant for the sake of its prurient appeal.",0,Argument
Such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the conduct and can justify the conclusion that the conduct is utterly without any redeeming social importance.,0,Argument
The determination of whether matter is obscene is not to be made by weighing its social value or importance against its alleged prurient appeal for it is not obscene unless it is utterly without social value or importance.,0,Argument
There is no question that appellants' claims were not filed within this time period and that no information was supplied to the Attorney General as outlined in §6500.03 of the Act.,0,Argument
(h) performs and obscene act or otherwise presents an obscene exhibition of his body in a public place.,0,Argument
"The constitutional standards provided in Miller and its attendant cases are those which are applicable to the issues raised in this appeal, and it is on this basis that we proceed in our review of appellant's contentions.",0,Argument
"Accordingly, we find that appellant suffered no loss by use of the ""social importance"" standard in §§28.45(a)(3) and 28.45(c) of the Guam Criminal and Correctional Code.",0,Argument
