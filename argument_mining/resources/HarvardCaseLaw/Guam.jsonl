BORDALLO, et al Defendants-Appellees</parties>\n  <docketnumber id=\"b179-4\">Civil Appeal No. 78-038A</docketnumber>\n  <court id=\"AfN\">District Court of Guam, Appellate Division</court>\n  <decisiondate id=\"ATl\">January 8, 1979</decisiondate>\n  <judges id=\"b180-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>DUENAS, District Judge; HILL, District Judge; BURNETT, Designated Judge.</judges>\n  <opinion type=\"majority\">\n    <p id=\"b180-3\">OPINION</p>\n    <author id=\"b180-4\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n    <p id=\"b180-5\">On February 5, 1976, the appellants sued the government of Guam on a cause of action alleging that the Government's failure to renew their teaching contracts was in violation of a 1972 collective bargaining agreement between the Department of Education and the Guam Federation of Teachers. On April 14, 1976, the Superior Court dismissed appellants' complaint for failure to comply with the Government of Guam Claims Act. We affirm.</p>\n    <p id=\"b180-6\">Appellants' claim for relief is based on a 1972 Three-Year Collective Bargaining Agreement which provides that all off-island teachers whose performance had been rated satisfactory would be offered similar reemployment by March 1 of the teacher's termination year, so long as the government of Guam policies provide for such hiring of teachers . on round-trip contracts. There is no question that all of the appellants had performed satisfactorily as teachers; however, their contracts were not renewed in a timely manner.</p>\n    <p id=\"b180-7\">The trial judge's dismissal of the complaint was based on a sovereign immunity defense. The Organic Act of Guam empowers the local legislature to waive sovereign immunity in tort and contract actions against the Government to the extent which it deems desirable. 48 USC 1421(a). The Government Code of Guam, \u00a7\u00a76500.00 et seq, provides for such waiver and \u00a76500.05 of the Claims Act requires that all claims against the Government must be filed within six months from the date the claim arose. There is no question that appellants' claims were not filed within this time period and that no information was supplied to the Attorney General as outlined in \u00a76500.03 of the Act.</p>\n    <p id=\"b180-8\">Appellants contend that the notice requirements under the Claims Act were substantially complied with because plaintiffs followed the grievance procedures contained in Article IV of the 1972 Collective Bargaining Agreement, thus giving the Government at least indirect notice of their desire to bring suit. However, no cases have been offered to support this novel theory of constructive notice, and, as the authority cited by the appellee makes clear, the jurisdictional requirements of government claims statutes must be strictly followed. See Veriddo v. Renard, 35 Cal.2d 263, 217 P.2d 647 (1950); Bleeck v. State, 52 N.Y.S.2d 894 (1945); 45 Cal.Jur.2d, State of California, \u00a7163. See also Busse v. U.S., 542 F.2d 421, 425 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>(7th Cir, 1976). Appellants' actions in following certain grievance procedures cannot be given such liberal construction as to suggest that the government of Guam received effective notice in this case.</p>\n    <p id=\"b181-4\">Appellants also argue that the sovereign immunity doctrine does not prevent litigants from seeking equitable relief compelling government officials to perform their duties properly (in this case requiring the Department of Education to issue contracts which become effective retroactively with full pay). It is clear that sovereign immunity applies to specific performance actions against the Government; otherwise the government cannot operate effectively if its every act is subject to injunctive actions. See Larson v. Domestic and Foreign Corporation, 337 U.S. 682, 69 S.Ct. 457, 93 L.Ed. 1629 (1948).

JAMES ROSARIO JONES Defendant-Appellant</parties>\n  <docketnumber id=\"b184-7\">Criminal No. 78-0034A</docketnumber>\n  <court id=\"A63g\">District Court of Guam, Appellate Division</court>\n  <decisiondate id=\"AQs\">June 19, 1980</decisiondate>\n  <judges id=\"b184-10\">DUENAS, District Judge; LAURETA, District Judge; BURNETT, Designated Judge</judges>\n  <opinion type=\"majority\">\n    <author id=\"b184-11\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n    <p id=\"b184-12\">Defendant in this case was indicted for violation of \u00a716.30 (Murder in the First Degree) and \u00a719.20 (Aggravated Assault) of the Guam Criminal and Correctional Code. The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>returned verdicts of guilty to the lesser included offense of manslaughter and also to the lesser included offense of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.</p>\n    <p id=\"b185-3\">In this appeal, appellant raises as his sole assignment of error the trial court's admission into evidence certain prior acts of a criminal nature committed by the defendant and submitted in this appeal as having been of such prejudicial effect to the appellant's trial as to constitute reversible error.</p>\n    <p id=\"b185-4\">The evidence complained of consisted of testimony of witnesses to the effect that appellant was involved in narcotic sales approximately six months prior to his meeting the victim, Alan Aflague. The appellant urges that the six-month period is too remote in time to be of sufficient relevance to the charge of first degree murder, and that the acts described by the testimony, because of their innate criminal character, were highly prejudicial as to outweigh any relevancy they may have had.</p>\n    <p id=\"b185-5\">The government's response is that the evidence of narcotics transactions was properly admitted as relevant to prove motive for murder, and since the jury returned a verdict of conviction on the lesser included offense of manslaughter, the admission of the evidence did not constitute harmful error.</p>\n    <p id=\"b185-6\">In determining the relevance of such evidence, the trial court must take into account the prejudicial effect of such evidence, and balance it against its corresponding probative value. In People v. Lopez, 1 Cal. App. 3d 78, 81 Cal. Rptr. 336, 391 (1969), the court said:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b185-7\">While it is the rule that evidence of other crimes is not admissible to prove the accused's disposition to commit crime, evidence to prove a relevant or material fact is not deemed inadmissible merely because it discloses the commission of another crime. (People v. Lopez, 60 Cal. 2d 223, 32 Cal. Rptr. 424 384 P.2d 16; People v. Peete, 28 Cal. 2d 306, 169 P.2d 924). And, because a motive is ordinarily the incentive for criminal behavior, its probative value generally exceeds its prejudicial effect, and wide latitude is permitted in admitting evidence of its existence. (People v. Sykes, 44 Cal. 2d 166, 280 P.2d 769; People v. Gonzales, 87 Cal. App. 2d 867, 198 P.2d 81).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b185-8\">The prejudicial effect inherent in the evidence of the narcotics transactions was the tendency to show that the defendant was of a bad character, and thus was likely to have committed the crimes charged. As such, the trial judge was required to assess the probative value against the prejudicial effect of the evidence. Here, the theory of the government's <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>case was that the appellant murdered the victim Aflague because appellant was told that Aflague was an undercover narcotics agent.</p>\n    <p id=\"b186-3\">Upon determining that the evidence was admissible, the trial court in this case correctly provided sufficient cautionary instructions to the jury that such evidence was to be considered for the limited purpose of showing the defendant's motive for committing the crime of murder and for no other purpose.</p>\n    <p id=\"b186-4\">We find that the admission of evidence of collateral narcotic transactions between appellant and persons unknown to the victim at a time six months prior to appellant and victim knowing each other was relevant and admissible for the limited purpose of showing appellant's motive in the killing.</p>\n    <p id=\"b186-5\">The government contends that it is not necessary for us to consider the propriety of the trial court's admitting into evidence the testimony relating to the appellant's narcotics transactions, the suggested reason being that the jury, having returned a verdict on the lesser included offense of manslaughter and acquitting the defendant of the murder charge, thereby demonstrated that it did not believe the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. However, we do not believe that it is our function as an appellate forum to second-guess the jury as to the basis for their verdict of conviction of manslaughter, despite the fact that the latter charge is a lesser included offense of murder.</p>\n    <p id=\"b186-6\">Nevertheless, we find no error on the part of the trial court in its admission of the evidence in issue, and accordingly affirm the judgment as rendered below.</p>\n    <p id=\"b186-7\">The judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

MANIBUSAN and LOURDES MANIBUSAN, Plaintiffs v. GUAM MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, Defendant</parties>\n  <court id=\"b74-4\">Superior Court of Guam</court>\n  <docketnumber id=\"AuT\">Civil Case No. 285-78</docketnumber>\n  <decisiondate id=\"Aop\">November 2, 1978</decisiondate>\n  <opinion type=\"majority\">\n    <author id=\"b74-11\">ABBATE, Judge</author>\n    <p id=\"b74-12\">DECISION</p>\n    <p id=\"b74-13\">This matter comes before the Court on Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration filed July 14, 1978. Defendant Guam Memorial Hospital, (GMH), filed its motion for summary judgment on May 26, 1978 asserting the applicability of the Government Claims Act (GC Sections 6500 et seq.) to suits against GMH. That motion was granted by an order filed July 13, 1978 which stated that \"plaintiff failed to comply with the Government Claims Act. . . . The Court finds that the intent of the Legislature was to include Guam Memorial Hospital within the statutory scheme of that act.\"</p>\n    <p id=\"b74-16\">Because of the possible wide ranging ramifications of the decision in this case the Court agreed to reconsider its prior decision on the basis of new evidence of the legislative intent.</p>\n    <p id=\"b75-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Initially, \u2022 it should be noted that the Court has considered the transcript of proceedings before the Legislature on May 11, 1977 dealing with Bill No. 182 which eventually became P.L. 14-29. The admission has been upheld against best evidence rule challenges. See People v. Ketchel, 59 Cal.2d 503 (1963). The affidavit of Ruth Ann Carter established the accuracy of the transcription.</p>\n    <p id=\"b75-3\">The transcript indicated that originally \u00a749003(g) describing powers of Guam Memorial Hospital Authority read:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b75-4\">(g) Sue or be sued in its own corporate name subject to the limitations and provisions of [the Government Claims Act. ]</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b75-5\">The discussion of May 11, 1977 dealt with the propriety of deleting any reference to the Government Claims Act, The transcript indicated that the language was deleted with full understanding that thereafter claims against GMH would not be paid through the Government Claims Fund but through GMH's own funds.</p>\n    <p id=\"b75-6\">Plaintiffs rely upon the transcript to bolster their original claim that the language of Government Code \u00a749003(g), as it passed into law, did not cloak the Guam Memorial Hospital'with the protection of the Government Claims Act.</p>\n    <p id=\"b75-7\">Defendant maintains that this interpretation is in direct conflict with other provisions of the Government Code.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b75-8\">\"\u00a76500.13. Limitation on Tort Liability</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b75-9\">(a) Government Health Professionals means any person who is licensed or certified to practice a \u2018healing art1 in Guam and is practicing that art within a Government of Guam facility as an agent of the Government of Guam.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b75-10\">(b) The Government of Guam shall be liable in tort for damages arising from the negligent acts of Government Health Professionals performed within Government of Guam facilities as an agent of the Government of Guam at the request of the government. Government Health Professionals shall be considered as an agent of the Government of Guam within the meaning of \u00a76500.20 of the Government Code.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b75-11\">(c) For all claims, the Government of Guam shall not be liable- for more than Thirty-Five Thousand Dollars ($35,000) in an action for wrongful death, nor for more than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in any other tort action.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b76-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>(d) The Government of Guam shall not be liable for interest prior to the date of judgment, nor for punitive damages.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b76-3\">\"\u00a76500.19. Payment. The Director of Administration shall pay the amount allowed in approved settlement under \u00a76500.10 or in a court judgment under \u00a76500.11, except as otherwise expressly provided by law. All payments under this Act shall be made from the Government Claims Fund. Claims against the Commercial Port, and the Public Utility Agency, Guam Power Authority, Guam Economic Development Authority, Guam Telephone Authority, Guam International Airport Authority, Gaming Commission, Guam Transit Authority and Guam Memorial Hospital Authority, however, shall be paid only out of the funds of those agencies.\" (Emphasis added).</p>\n    <p id=\"b76-4\">It should be noted that \u00a76500.13 was repealed and reenacted by \u00a78 of P.L. 13-116. Section 9 of that Act provided that the provisions of \u00a78 would expire automatically one year from the effective date of that act, which was December 24, 1975. Section 6 of P.L. 14-29 repealed \u00a79 of P.L. 13-116 after the expiration date. For this reason, plaintiffs maintain that \u00a76500.13 is of no force and effect.</p>\n    <p id=\"b76-5\">However, common law rules of interpretation state that the repeal of a repealing statute operates to revive the original enactment where the repeal of the repealing statute is accomplished by express provision without additional legislation on the subject matter. 1A Sutherland on Statutory Construction, \u00a723.31 (3rd Ed.). It is the opinion of this Court that \u00a76500.13 was revived by \u00a76 of P.L. 14-29. It is worthy of note that in addition to the provisions dealing with health professionals, \u00a76500.13 includes the limitations on liability which are an essential part of the Government Claims Act.</p>\n    <p id=\"b76-6\">Defendant argues that it is impossible to reconcile plaintiff's position with the language of \u00a76500.19 which mentions \"claims against\" GMH. Defendant argues that the correct interpretation of the various provisions is that the Claims Act procedures are applicable while in the event of liability, GMH funds, rather than Government Claims Fund, will be drawn against. However, it must be remembered that at the time of the May 11, 1977 deletion \u00a76500.19 was already in effect. That section expressly states that the Government Claims Fund will not be used to pay for claims against GMH. Therefore, the deletion of reference to the Claims Act would have been meaningless unless, as plaintiff argues, it eliminated any need to resort to the procedures of the Claims Act when suit is filed against GMH.</p>\n    <p id=\"b77-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Such a result is not in conflict with \u00a76500.13. The provisions can be reconciled by a holding which makes Claims Act procedures applicable to suits against individual Government Health Professionals and inapplicable to suits against GMH itself.</p>\n    <p id=\"b77-3\">Although the issue is not squarely before the Court at this time, it will be noted that \"claims against\" GMH in \u00a76500.19 may in fact mean suits against Health Professionals employed by GMH.</p>\n    <p id=\"b77-4\">It is the holding of this Court that Government Claims Act procedures are not applicable to suits against Guam Memorial Hospital.</p>\n    <p id=\"b77-5\">For the foregoing reasons, on reconsideration, defendant's motion for summary judgment is DENIED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b77-6\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

PHILLIP TAIJERON, EARL AGUIGUI, THE GOVERNMENT OF GUAM and DOE INSURANCE CO. Defendants</parties>\n  <docketnumber id=\"b90-9\">Civil No. 785-77</docketnumber>\n  <court id=\"ATs\">Superior Court of Guam</court>\n  <decisiondate id=\"Ay7\">March 20, 1980</decisiondate>\n  <opinion type=\"majority\">\n    <author id=\"b90-12\">RAKER, Judge</author>\n    <p id=\"b90-13\">DECISION AND ORDER</p>\n    <p id=\"b90-14\">This matter came before the Court on defendant's summary judgment motion and motion to dismiss. Defendant was represented by Assistant Attorney General Roger Willmeth, the plaintiff was represented by Timothy Stewart. The motions were heard by Judge John P. Raker and decision was reserved.</p>\n    <p id=\"b91-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Defendant's motion to dismiss is based on \u00a76500.10 of the Government Claims Act, which defendant argues divests the Court of jurisdiction over counts one and two of the first cause of action, count one of the third cause of action, counts one and two of the fourth cause of action and counts one and two of the fifth cause of action.</p>\n    <p id=\"b91-3\">The Court first will examine this claim as regards the first and third causes of action. The first cause of action sounds in negligence, count one against defendant Taijeron and count two against defendant Aguigui. Plaintiff has plead $200.00 in damages on each count. The third cause of action is against defendant Taijeron for negligent supervision and claims $400,000 in damages. Each of these counts are against an individual defendant government employee and plead in excess of $100,000 damages.</p>\n    <p id=\"b91-4\">It is defendant's position that the Court lacks jurisdiction as Government Code \u00a76500.10 prohibits actions against an individual defendant once a claim has been filed pursuant to the Government Claims Act, as was done in this case. Such a position does not take, into account Government Code \u00a76500.20, which specifically allows \"further proceedings against the employee\" if \"the Court certifies that it would have awarded the claimant more but for the limitations of 6500.13.\" Section 6500.13 limits the Government's liability to $100,000.00 (See Decision and Order of February 11, 1980, Paulin v. Government of Guam, Superior Court civil Case No. 842-78.) Thus all of the above counts are specifically authorized by Government Code \u00a76500.20 as more than $100,000 is claimed, and these counts are within the jurisdiction of the Court. The motion to dismiss as to these counts is therefore DENIED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b91-5\">The second claim that this Court lacks jurisdiction regards counts one and two of the fourth and fifth causes of action. These are once again against the individual named defendants, but in this instance based on allegations of intentional tort. Once again defendants base their claim that the Court lacks jurisdiction over these counts on a reading of Section 6500.10.</p>\n    <p id=\"b91-6\">Guam's Government Claims Act differs from those of many other jurisdictions, for while the act waives the sovereign immunity of the territory, it does not indemnify or immunize the employee. Rather, it provides that judgment or settlement of a government claims action bars further action against the employee (6500.20). Further, the Act only covers negligent torts, and sovereign immunity is not waived for intentional wrongs of the employee.</p>\n    <p id=\"b91-7\">Thus there is no possibility of a Government Claims Action based on an intentional tort, and the plaintiff has not attempted to plead such a cause of action. What plaintiff has done is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>proceed on alternative theories; negligence against the Government (and should they prove more than $100,000 in damages against the individuals) and intentional tort against the individual. Defendants would read \u00a76500.10 to preclude such alternative causes of action.</p>\n    <p id=\"b92-3\">This reading of \u00a76500.10 reaches an absurd result. The legislature has made the determination that it will make it possible to proceed against the territory rather than the employee on negligence claims. Thus employees are freed to some extent from concern about individual liability which make them overly cautious about their actions being found negligent and adversely affect their function as employees. The legislature determined that a similar rationale did not exist for intentional wrong doing by government employees. Yet the reading of \u00a76500.10 urged by defendants is that simply by plaintiff's' act of filing a claim with the government for alleged negligence an employee is completely immunized should it turn out that the act was intentional. Thus the act would provide absolute protection for an intentional tort-feasor, while providing a recovery against no one, and would indemnify a negligent tort-feasor to the extent of $100,000. This is a very strange result, and there is no indication that this was the intent of the legislature. Beyond creating a chilling effect on filing a claim with the government because a plaintiff would lose all should he be mistaken in his theory, this reading also creates troublesome due process problems as such an irrevocable election would have to e made before the plaintiff has the opportunity for any sort of discovery. The election would have to be made before the filing of claim, let alone a law suit.</p>\n    <p id=\"b92-4\">It is the decision of this Court that any bar to a plaintiff's action against an individual tort-feasor under the Government Claims Act (Government Code \u00a76500 et. seq.) is limited to actions which may be brought under the Claims Act, and thus does not affect an allegation of an intentional tort.</p>\n    <p id=\"b92-5\">The motion to dismiss causes of action four and five is DENIED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b92-6\">The final motion to be disposed of is a summary judgment motion on the second cause of action. The basis of this motion is that this cause of action for negligent hiring, training and supervision of the defendant employees is not within the scope of the claim filed by plaintiff, and thus barred. Resolution of this motion requires examination of the claim filed. The claim is for \"all injuries proximately caused by the negligence... of the Government of Guam, its officers and employees, for injuries arising out of the wrongful arrest and wrongful imprisonment of claimant.. .said wrongful arrest and wrongful imprisonment having occurred on May 1, 1976, and May 2, 1976.\" This claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>for negligence of all employees resulting in these specified injuries, though broad, obviously includes negligent hiring, training and supervision of the employees involved in the incident.</p>\n    <p id=\"b93-3\">Defendant relies on Kauss v. Government of Guam, Superior Court Case No. 680-77. But in Kauss summary judgment was granted where a plaintiff filed a claim for intentional acts, and later a complaint for negligence. Here there is no question that the claim and complaint sound in negligence.</p>\n    <p id=\"b93-6\">The question is whether the claim is too broad, rather than too narrow as in Kauss. The notice of claim is not a pleading, neither is it a trap for the unwary. The claimant is not required to list his theories of recovery, but rather the facts which lead to liability. The Court notes that such a claim may often be prepared by a lay person of limited education.</p>\n    <p id=\"b93-9\">If the claim gives such facts as would enable the Government to investigate its liability, it should be judged sufficient. The government has all the tools of any civil suit to refine the plaintiff's theory before trial. By this standard the plaintiffs claim, though broad, is sufficient.</p>\n    <p id=\"b93-10\">The motion for summary judgment is DENIED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b93-11\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

A prisoner has certain vested rights, similar to a parolee, once he is afforced the benefits of participating in a work-release program. As stated in Durso v. Rowe, 579 F.2d 1365 (7th Cir. 1978) at 1371:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b143-10\">\"We are compelled to note the strong similarities between parole and work-release. Indeed, many of the 'core values of unqualified liberty' which the Supreme Court recognized that parolees enjoy, see Morrissey, supra, 408 U.S. at 482, 92 S.Ct. 2593, are also present here. Like a parolee, a convict on work-release can pursue employment or education. He is eligible for leaves to renew contacts with his family. He may also be released to participate in unsupervised activities in the community, such as shopping, recreation and visiting friends. A work-release participant's freedom is more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>limited than a parolee's. That difference, however, is one of degree only. The extent and nature of his freedom is qualitatively different from any 'freedom' allowed at the prison. Moreover, revocation of that status entails a loss far more grievous than that sustained by one who is transferred from one prison to another.\"</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b144-3\">No evidence was presented by the Department of Corrections to suggest that there were exigent circumstances which would justify the removal of the petitioners from the work-release hearing without a prior hearing. Obviously prison administrators have great discretion in supervising prisoners; however, it is only when a prisoner's actions might reasonably endanger prison security or the safety of the public in general, that a prisoner's vested rights may be temporarily suspended prior to a full and adequate hearing.</p>\n    <p id=\"b144-4\">Strauss was returned to the Adult Main Facility on December 5, 1979, where at a preliminary hearing the charges were read to him and he was asked how he wanted to plead. Strauss was then put in closed confinement for approximately a week where he was restricted to his cell for twenty-four hours a day, except for a half hour to take a shower and fresh air. The charges brought against Strauss had to do with an incident occurring around Thanksgiving when he called a local newspaper to complain about the fact that certain holiday furloughs had been cancelled. On December 11, 1979 a final hearing was held, which resulted in Strauss permanent removal from the work-release program and a demotion in step level.</p>\n    <p id=\"b144-5\">Root was returned to the Adult Main Facility sometime around March 26, 1978, and he was put into solitary confinement without the benefit of a hearing. On April 28, 1978 three was a reclassification hearing, where, according to his testimony, he was not given an opportunity to question witnesses regarding the assault charges brought against him.</p>\n    <p id=\"b144-6\">Santos was taken out of the work-release program and returned to the Adult Main Facility on January 6, 1980, where he was placed in solitary confinement. There was a final hearing on January 18, 1980, where he was charged with possession of alcohol and antagonizing another inmate. After the final hearing, he was placed in closed confinement for thirty days, with an additional thirty-day probation.</p>\n    <p id=\"b144-7\">Reyes was returned to the Adult Main Facility on November 25, 1978. He was immediately placed in closed confinement until a hearing on December 13, 1978 when he was found guilty of fighting with another inmate. Prison officials allegedly the denied Reyes' request to produce certain witnesses.</p>\n    <p id=\"b144-8\">As developed above, the removal of a prisoner from a work-release program can result in a grievous loss of employment and certain due process standards attach to protect these rights to participate in the Step IV program. Not only were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the petitioners removed from the program without a hearing, but they were also placed in solitary confinement pending any actual resolution of the charges against them. The Government has offered no evidence to suggest that the isolated activities charged against each petitioner were such a serious threat to prison security or community safety that a prior hearing was not practicable.</p>\n    <p id=\"b145-3\">This is not to minimize the seriousness of the offenses charged; however, benefits afforded a prisoner on a work-release program are similar to those of a prisoner on parole, thus requiring greater rights to a hearing than might normally be associated with general prison discipline and administrative procedures. The uncontradicted testimony of Root and Reyes suggest that the right to confront and produce witnesses was limited when their cases were heard.</p>\n    <p id=\"b145-4\">The February 22, 1980 Order of the District Court, returning the petitioners to the Halfway House Facility, is not a ruling on the merits of the charges against them. The Order was issued so that petitioners' partially vested rights could be reestablished fully, pending a fair and adequate hearing seeking to divest any such rights to work on the outside. The Government has failed to show any justification for not conducting an adequate hearing before petitioners' actual removal from the work-release program, and for not affording petitioners their full due process rights at such a hearing. In some cases the gravity of certain offenses could justify the disciplinary removal of a prisoner from work release prior to a full hearing; however, no exigent circumstances to justify such removal have been shown by the Government to exist in the cases at bar.</p>\n    <p id=\"b145-5\">Finally, the Government contends that the Director does not have the authority to transfer prisoners out of the Adult Main Facility to participate in work-release program, citing to \u00a739100.2 and \u00a755015 of the Government Code (providing that no prisoner at the Adult Main Facility shall be allowed to participate in any extramural program without the express order of the parole board). However, assuming that these sections apply to the petitioners, it would seem that the Director conversely has no authority to remove prisoners from the Halfway House Correctional Facility without the express approval of the parole board. See e.g. Durso v. Rowe, supra, and \u00a739100.2 of the Government Code, stating that the provisions of the Chapter dealing with parole shall apply when considering the eligibility for extramural programs.</p>\n    <p id=\"b145-6\">There is no question that the petitioners' rights guaranteed under Wolff v. McDonnel, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974) and its progeny (e.g. Durso v. Rowe, supra) were ignored by the Director of Corrections. With the reestablishment of petitioners' rights to participate in the Halfway House Correctional Work-Release Program, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Government is put on notice that an unhampered approach to the supervision and administration of inmates cannot override certain of their constitutional rights to a fair and adequate disciplinary hearing.</p>\n    <p id=\"b146-3\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b146-4\">Dated this 25th day of March, 1980.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

On Eebruary 8, 1928 he was released on bail pending appeal.</p>\n    <p id=\"b190-10\">The alleged delivery of heroin occurred on June 28, 1976. The indictment upon which he was convicted was brought on June 14, 1922. Appellant moved to dismiss the indictment on August 6, 1922, alleging that he had been denied due process of law and his right to a speedy trial because of the passage of more that eleven months between the alleged offense and his arrest and indictment. His motion was denied on October 14, 1922.</p>\n    <p id=\"b190-11\">Appellant's case was called for trial on October 11, 1977. The jury was selected the same day. On October <em>14, 1922 </em>Appellant moved for a mistrial on the ground that one of the selected jurors had been a member of the jury panel in prior criminal case<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> involving substantially similar issues, in which case the trial judge has stated his disagreement to the jury for their verdict of acquittal. Appellant's motion for dismissal was denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b190-12\">The case proceeded to trial. At trial the prosecution submitted evidence of criminal activity by Appellant other than that which he was charged, including delivery of heroin on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>June 11, 1976 and a statement made by Appellant on June 13, 1977 relating to heroin dealings in which he was involved, not including the transaction of June 28, 1976. Defense counsel objected to the admission of the evidence, arguing that it was irrelevant and immaterial to the charge, that its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect (citing People v. Perez, 42 Cal. App. 3d 760, 177 Cal. Rptr. 195 [1974], and that a comprehensive stipulation regarding Appellant's heroin addiction and familiarity with \"the terms of drug transaction\" had been entered into by counsel and read to the jury at the beginning of trial, thereby obviating the necessity for the submitted evidence. During the course of the trial. Appellant offered evidence of (1) a police report by an Officer Figgeroa to establish police bias and motive to fabricate charges against him, and (2) a laboratory report by a criminalist, Mrs. Osborne, who had died sometime prior to trial. With the latter report. Appellant intended to prove a break in the chain of custody of the substances allegedly seized from him by the inconsistency of Mrs. Osborne's findings with that of the government's witness, Chief Criminalist Frankie Ishizaki. The trial court denied the admission of both the police report and Mrs. Osborne's report.</p>\n    <p id=\"b191-3\">Appellant was ultimately found guilty as charged.</p>\n    <p id=\"b191-4\">Four grounds of error are raised on appeal.</p>\n    <p id=\"b191-5\">I</p>\n    <p id=\"b191-6\">The first assignment of error is that Appellant was denied due process of law and his right to a speedy trial by what characterizes as an unjustified delay between the alleged offense and his trial. Because he was not provided with notice of the charge for almost one year. Appellant maintains he had to contend with loss of memory and the inability to obtain witnesses in his behalf, and that, with the passage of time his ability to defend himself diminished while the government's case was conversely strengthened.</p>\n    <p id=\"b191-7\">Appellant further urges that, on the facts of this case, the government has the burden of explaining the delay between the alleged offense and Appellant's arrest and indictment. However, Officer Figgeroa testified that he was working undercover at the time of the alleged offense and an early arrest would have blown his cover; and that he had other cases going on at the same time.</p>\n    <p id=\"b191-8\">We disagree with Appellant's contentions on the basis of United States v. Lovasco, 97 S. Ct. 455 (1971).</p>\n    <p id=\"b191-9\">In Lovasco, the defendant was indicted for committing federal criminal offenses more than 18 months after they allegedly occurred. Little additional information was developed beyond an investigative report made a month after the crimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>were committed. Claiming that the preindictment delay, during which material defense testimony had been lost, deprived him of due process, defendant moved to dismiss the indictment. The District Court granted the motion to dismiss and the Court of Appeals affirmed. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed, holding that it was error to dismiss the indictment. Citing Marion, supra, the Court ruled that the Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment is applicable only after a person has been accused of a crime and that statutes of limitation provide the primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges. It was also stated in Lovasco that while the Due Process Clause has a limited role to play in protecting against oppressive delay, to prosecute a defendant following good faith investigative delay does not deprive him of due process even if his defense might have been somewhat prejudiced by the lapse of time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court further stated that prosecutors are under no duty to file charges as soon as probable cause exists but before they are satisfied that they will be able to establish a suspect's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Nor is there a constitutional requirement that charges must be filed after there is sufficient evidence to prove such guilt but before the investigation is complete, the rationale being that an immediate arrest or indictment might impair the prosecutor's ability to continue the investigation or obtain additional indictments, and would pressure prosecutors into resolving doubtful cases in favor of early (and possible unwarranted) prosecutions, and further would preclude full consideration of the desirability of not prosecuting in particular cases.</p>\n    <p id=\"b192-4\">The Court determined that it could not determine in the abstract the circumstances in which prosecution delay would require dismissing prosecutions, and left to the lower courts the task of applying \"settled principles of due process.\"</p>\n    <p id=\"b192-5\">In light of Lovasco, it is significant to note that the limitations period for the crime with which Appellant had been convicted is three years. (Guam Penal Code, \u00a7800). The \"delay\" complained of was less than one year and good faith investigative delay was shown in this case. This explanation is permissible under Lovasco.</p>\n    <p id=\"b192-6\">Appellant argues that the Government did not justify the lapse of eleven months between the alleged transaction and the indictment. We find to the contrary. In Marion, supra, which involved a 38-month preindictment delay, the Court .stated that the Due Process Clause may provide the basis for dismissing an indictment if the defense can demonstrate that the preindictment delay by the Government violated the Due Process Clause. It was pointed out in Marion that no actual prejudice to the conduct of the defense was alleged or proved, and there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>showing that the Government intentionally delayed to gain some tactical advantage over the defendants or harass them:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b193-3\">Appellees rely solely on the real possibility of prejudice inherent in any extended delay: that memories will dim, witnesses become inaccessible, and evidence be lost. In light of the applicable statute of limitations, however, these possibilities are not in themselves enough to demonstrate that appellees cannot receive a fair trial and to therefore justify the dismissal of the indictment. (Marion, supra at 466).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b193-4\">Marion thus appears to place the onus on the defense to prove prejudice stemming from prosecutorial delay. The case of Barker v. Wingo, 92 S. Ct. 2182 (1977) has held that there is no set formula or time limit in determining the prejudicial effect of delay, but rather that the test is one of balancing. In the case sub judice, the reasons for not making an immediate arrest and for the passage of eleven months before the indictment was brought against Appellee, do not constitute an unreasonable striking of the balance in favor of the Government. We therefore hold there is no merit to Appellant's claim that he was denied his rights to due process of law and a speedy trial because of prosecutorial delay.</p>\n    <p id=\"b193-5\">II</p>\n    <p id=\"b193-6\">Appellant next complains that the jury was prejudiced against him by comments made by the trial judge to an earlier jury panel which included a member of Appellant's jury panel.</p>\n    <p id=\"b193-7\">On October 7, 1977 Lourdes T. Aguon was acquitted of a narcotics offense. She was accused of delivering heroin to an undercover agent. After the verdict was read the defendant was told to leave the courtroom, and both counsel for the defense and the prosecution left as well. The trial judge then made the following comment to the jury:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b193-8\">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, while it is customarily not the function of the court to tell what the court thinks of the verdict, because it not my job, however as politely that I can tell you the Court does not agree with the verdict. This is my humble opinion and, of course, it is your function to judge the facts and I can tell you what the law is. But while we do this in very rare cases, I just wanted to convey my humble opinion that in this case we differed, but this is the jury system and we accept it as such and I certainly want to give you my thanks for the contribution you rendered in this case and in future cases. I'm sorry we took so late, but have a pleasant evening and good night.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b194-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>On October 11, 1977, the jurors from the Aguon jury-appeared with other jurors before the same trial judge for jury selection in the case now on appeal before this court. People v. Anthony M. Salas. The attorney for Appellant picked one juror that had been on the jury panel which had had their verdict commented on by the judge. The trial attorney did not know that the judge had expressed his opinion on the verdict in the other case until after the jury was impaneled.</p>\n    <p id=\"b194-3\">At the first opportunity after hearing of the comment on the verdict in the prior case, the defense asked for a transcript and, upon receipt thereof, immediately moved for a mistrial. The motion was denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b194-4\">Appellant cites United States v. Kyle, 469 F. 2d 547 (D.C. Cir. 1972), cert. denied 93 S. Ct. 920 (1973) as authority that the motion for mistrial was erroneously denied. In Kyle three of the jurors in the defendant's case had two days earlier served on a jury in the case of United States v. Artis (citation omitted). After the jury returned a verdict of not guilty in Artis, it was subjected to the following statement by the trial judge:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b194-5\">I just want to say this to the jury: Of course the jury has decided the question of guilt or innocence of this defendant. I don't think I deviated from this policy in the almost <em>13h </em>years I have been on the court. I have seen some surprising verdicts, frankly, but this beats anything I ever heard. And you members of the community who are always concerned about the crime situation, to return a verdict like this in this case, I must say, and the Assistant U.S. Attorney almost keeled over, I noticed, when the jury announced the verdict, I would be ashamed of this verdict. Thank you very much.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b194-6\">(United State v. Kyle, supra at 548-549 citing United States v. Artis.)</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b194-7\">The court in Kyle, while expressing its strong disapproval of the \"acrimonious remarks\" of the trial judge in Artis, noted the dissimilitude between the two cases, and found no error warranting the reversal of Kyle.</p>\n    <p id=\"b194-8\">The differences between Artis and Kyle cited by the court on appeal included the fact that the defendant, both counsel, the witnesses, and most significantly the judges, were not the same, and that counsel for both the government and appellant carefully examined the jurors during voir dire for the possibility of prejudice. Each of the jurors had taken an oath, agreeing to return a verdict solely upon the evidence adduced during the course of the trial.</p>\n    <p id=\"b194-9\">Using Kyle as our guide, we now turn to the question of whether the jury in Salas had been unduly prejudiced by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>comments made to the jury panel in Aguon. We begin with the premise that while it is appropriate for the court to thank jurors at the conclusion of a trial for their public service, such comments should not include praise or criticism of their verdict. ABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Trial by Jury \u00a75.6 (Approved Draft, 1968). Any inference by the court that the jury may have arrived at an incorrect verdict, whether or not done with an intent to influence the jury, has the potential of being highly prejudicial to a subsequent case which includes in its jury panel persons who were members of the panel whose verdict was commented upon by the trial judge. It is academic that the situation is exacerbated where the same type of case and the same trial judge are involved.</p>\n    <p id=\"b195-3\">Salas is distinguishable from Kyle in that the offenses in the latter case were apparently different from those in its predecessor case, Artis, while in Salas the offense was substantially the same as that in Aguon. Further, the judge who addressed the jury on their verdict was the same judge who presided in Salas. His mere physical presence could well have served as a reminder to the two jurors, who in turn may have exerted an influence on their fellow jurors, that their verdict in Aguon was wrong and that the opportunity for a verdict of redemption was now before them.</p>\n    <p id=\"b195-4\">On the other hand, the comment of the Salas judge, spoken without the invective of the trial judge in Kyle, also included the concession that the jury was the sole arbiter of guilt or innocence. Certainly this does not purge the judge's comments of all potential for influence. Nevertheless, it illustrates an important difference between the Salas judge's comments and the castigation delivered in Artis and cited in Kyle. Unlike the jury in Artis, the jury in Salas was reminded of its function as a sole finder of guilt or innocence of the accused and that it was not customary for the trial judge to openly interpose his opinion of the wisdom of the jury's verdict.</p>\n    <p id=\"b195-5\">It can only be surmised what effect the trial judge's statement \"I just wanted to convey my humble opinion that in this case we differed\" may have had on the two jurors in Salas. We find, however, that it was qualitatively far removed from the phillipic \"I have seen some surprising verdicts, frankly, but this beats anything I have ever heard,\" and the ensuing berating of the jury by the court in Artis. We also take cognizance of the extensive cautionary jury instructions in Salas regarding the duty of the jury to perform its duty without bias or prejudice.</p>\n    <p id=\"b196-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>We conclude, then, that while any comment on a jury's verdict, whether laudatory or unfavorable, is to be condemned, in the present case the comment by the trial judge did not reach the level of error warranting the granting of motion for mistrial.</p>\n    <p id=\"b196-3\">Ill</p>\n    <p id=\"b196-4\">Appellant's next contention is that the trial court committed error by admitting evidence of his involvement in \"additional bad acts\" extraneous to the charge brought against him.</p>\n    <p id=\"b196-5\">The general rule is that evidence of other crimes is inadmissible to prove criminal disposition, but they are admissible to prove motive, opportunity, intent, common design or plan, knowledge or identity. People v. Archerd, 3 Cal. 3d 615, 477, P. 2d 421 (1970). see Fed. R. Evid. 404(b). Further, the probative value of the evidence must outweigh its prejudicial effect and the evidence must logically tend to prove an issue in dispute. People v. Perez, 42 Cal. App. 3d 760, 117 Cal. Rptr. 195 (1974).</p>\n    <p id=\"b196-7\">Defendant made a statement that he was dealing three to five caps of heroin per day in June of 1976. He also stated that he made a profit of about $500.00 per drug deal. The government contends that these admissions are relevant for various purposes to establish intent and also to establish the motive for the offense charged, and that the defendant's offered stipulation of his drug addiction and familiarity with \"the terms of drug transaction\" was not \"coextensive with all of the things that the statement could be introduced to show.\" Appellant argues that he offered a stipulation as to his drug activity but that the stipulation was not accepted and evidence was admitted, and that the rejection of the stipulation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and admission of the evidence was reversible error.</p>\n    <p id=\"b196-8\">We agree that admission of the evidence of prior drug usage was erroneous. To go beyond that which was stipulated and to have allowed the prosecution to detail the incidents of defendant's drug-related activities, was highly prejudicial in that it raised issues collateral to the offense charged. As to the appellant's intent and motive, we believe that these issues were sufficiently resolved by the officers' testimony, and unless the defendant (Appellant) had taken the stand and made statements tending to negate motive and intent, the prejudicial effect of the admitted evidence could very likely have outweighed any probative value it may have had. The case of People v. Guzman, 121 Cal. Rptr. 69 (1975) makes clear that the court should search for other alternatives before offering evidence of prior criminal activity, due to the prejudicial nature of such evidence.</p>\n    <p id=\"b196-9\">The defendant in Guzman was charged with robbery. He offered testimony that he had received a workmen's <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>compensation check to show that he had no need to commit the robbery. The prosecution countered by offering evidence that he was a narcotic addict. The defendant attempted to prevent the admission of the evidence concerning his narcotics addiction by stipulating that the money from the check had been spent prior to the robbery. The stipulation was rejected and the evidence of his addiction was admitted. The court held that it was reversible error not to accept the defendant's offered stipulation, and stated:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b197-3\">\"The Supreme Court had recently had occasion to again point out the extremely prejudicial nature of evidence of prior crimes and the necessity for examining the admissibility of such evidence with extreme care. (People v. Kelley [1967] 66 Cal. 2d 232, 57 Cal. Rptr. 363, 424 P.2d 947; People v. Haston [1968] 69 Cal. 2d 233, 70 Cal. Rptr. 419, 444 P.2d 91.) Evidence of prior crimes should be admitted only when there is a real issue to which such evidence is directed. (People v. Gregg [1968] 266 Cal. App.2d 389, 71 Cal. Rptr. 920; People v. Perez [1974] 42 Cal. App.3d 760, 763-766, 117 Cal. Rptr. 195.)</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b197-4\">Every effort should be made to meet the issue in another way or eliminate it entirely. Where it is possible to meet the issue by a stipulation it is error to refuse to do so and thus unnecessarily bring before the jury the evidence of other crimes. (People v. Gonzales [1968] 262 Cal. App.2d 286, 68 Cal. Rptr. 578.) This is particularly true where the other crime involved the use of narcotics. There is a grave danger that, notwithstanding proper instructions as to the limited use of the evidence, the jury will nevertheless view it as affecting the reliability of the witness' testimony. (People v. Davis [1965] 233 Cal. App.2d 156, 43 Cal. Rptr. 357.) . . .\" Id. At 74.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b197-5\">Guzman is distinguishable from Appellant's case in that in Guzman the defendant had offered testimony to prove he had no need to commit the robbery, and the prosecution countered with evidence of his narcotic addiction. In the present case, the Appellant offered a stipulation, not testimony, as to his drug activity, and the evidence submitted by the government was offered not to rebut the stipulation but to bolster the government's case.</p>\n    <p id=\"b197-6\">Notwithstanding this distinction, and despite our disagreement with Appellant's contention that the proffered stipulation would have served the same purpose as the introduction of the Appellant's prior involvement with drug related activity, we feel that in the weighing of probative value vis-a-vis prejudicial effect, the balance must be struck in favor of the Appellant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>We can only leave to conjecture how pivotal the admitted evidence was in the jury's deliberation of guilt or innocence, and rather than second-guess what effect it may have had, we find instead that the admission of the evidence at trial against Appellant was prejudicial error.</p>\n    <p id=\"b198-3\">IV</p>\n    <p id=\"b198-4\">Appellant's fourth assignment of error is that evidence offered by the defense for the purpose of impeaching the government's witnesses and of attacking the chain of custody of the evidence against him was improperly excluded at his trial.</p>\n    <p id=\"b198-5\">The evidence in issue are two reports which the Appellant attempted to introduce into evidence. The trial court denied the admission of both reports.</p>\n    <p id=\"b198-6\">The first report was a police report by an Officer Figgeroa which contained the Appellant's statements alleging police bias and the motive to bring false charges against him.</p>\n    <p id=\"b198-7\">We find that the exclusion of this report was not improper. Besides being wholly self-serving, whatever relevancy may have been gleaned from the assertions therein were substantially outweighed by the likelihood of confusing the issues before the jury.</p>\n    <p id=\"b198-8\">The second report offered into evidence was a laboratory report by a criminalist, Mrs. Ellen Osborne, who had died on June 24, 1977. By the introduction of this report Appellant intended to demonstrate a break in the chain of custody of the substances allegedly seized from him. Appellant also attempted to show that Criminalists Ishizaki and Osborne, although supposedly utilizing the same tests and analyzing the same substances, obtained results which were dramatically at variance with the allowable parameters of accuracy for the apparatus used in the analysis of the substances.</p>\n    <p id=\"b198-9\">We are persuaded by Appellant's argument that Mrs. Osborne's report should have been admitted to place before the jury the inconsistency of her report with that of the government's witness, Criminalist Ishizaki.</p>\n    <p id=\"b198-10\">Upon review of Appellant's argument, we conclude that the report was in fact admissible, under both an exception to the hearsay rule, and more importantly, as required by the confrontation and compulsory process clauses of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See e.g. United States v. Smith, 521 F.2d 957 (D.C. Cir. 1975).</p>\n    <p id=\"b198-11\">Mrs. Osborne's report was crucial to Appellant's defense. Inasmuch as it was eligible to qualify as an exception to the hearsay rule and would otherwise have been admissible under the compulsory process clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the trial court's denial of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>admission at trial in behalf of Appellant constituted prejudicial error.</p>\n    <p id=\"b199-3\">V</p>\n    <p id=\"b199-4\">In conclusion, then, we hold that the Appellant's submission of Mrs. Osborne's report into evidence was improperly denied. We further hold that the admission of evidence of Appellant's involvement in drug activity other than that constituting the offense for which he was charged constituted reversible error and accordingly, we REVERSE the judgment of conviction and REMAND for a new trial.</p>\n    <p id=\"b199-6\">Footnote:</p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n      <p id=\"b199-7\">. viz.

EDWIN I. CAMACHO, Defendant</parties>\n  <docketnumber id=\"b26-4\">Criminal No. 283F-77</docketnumber>\n  <court id=\"AL\">Superior Court of Guam</court>\n  <decisiondate id=\"Af\">September 27, 1979</decisiondate>\n  <opinion type=\"majority\">\n    <author id=\"b26-11\">ABBATE, Judge</author>\n    <p id=\"b26-12\">DECISION AND ORDER</p>\n    <p id=\"b26-13\">Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment was heard on September 25, 1979. Defendant bases his motion on three grounds;</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b26-14\">(1) Defendant was denied the right to a speedy trial since almost two years elapsed from the filing of the indictment to his arraignment.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b26-15\">(2) At the time of the alleged escape defendant was recognized by the court as being legally insane.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b27-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>(3) At the time of the alleged escape from the Guam Penitentiary, defendant was being illegally incarcerated.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b27-3\">The Court will address these issues respectively.</p>\n    <p id=\"b27-4\">As to the first issue, defendant was indicted on October 14, 1977 for escaping from the Guam Penitentiary on October 11, 1977. Defendant was finally arraigned on September 5, 1979. While it is true that this is almost a span of two years, a review of the record indicated ample justifications for the delay. To wit: there was a pending murder charge against defendant; defendant\u2019s commitment to the Mental Health Center for treatment; psychiatric examinations to determine his competency to stand trial on two different occasions; various withdrawals by different counsels from the case; various motions filed by defendant's attorney; defendant's behavior at the Mental Health Center; the arraignment being continued until defendant is found competent to stand trial. These reasons show that the delay was not purposeful or oppressive. Maguire v. U.S., 396 F2d 327 (9th Cir 1968); York v U.S., 389 F2d 761 (9th Cir. 1968); Barker v. Municipal Court of Salinas Judicial District of Monterey County. 51 Cal. Rptr. 921, 64C.2d 806 415 P 2d 809)</p>\n    <p id=\"b27-5\">As to the second issue, defendant predicated this on the November 15, 1977 Judgment of the Superior Court which found that \"defendant was insane at the time of the crime (murder) under the criteria set out in Wade v. United States, 426 F2d 64 (1970) and \u00a726 (4) Guam Penal Code' and that he is 'presently' insane within \u00a71367 Guam Penal Code.\" (See Judgment filed November 11, 1977). In retrospect, the court finds the phrase \"and that he is presently insane within \u00a71367 Guam Penal Code\" to be dicta, the court feels justified in so holding since the Judgment was qualifiedly based on (1) the Stipulation to Finding and Judgment of Not Guilty By Reason of Insanity\" submitted by defense counsel and the Attorney General's Office, and (2) on the report of court psychiatrist. Dr. Frances Reid. A review of the Stipulation reveals that it solely addressed \"that he was insane at the time of the commission of the crime herein.\" (See Stipulation filed September 25, 1977). Hence, it is clear there was no factual basis on both the Stipulation and Dr. Reid's report to have held that defendant was \"presently-insane\" at the date of judgment. Also, defendant's sanity at the time of the alleged escape (October 11, 1977) was not an issue in the Stipulation. Finally, this court questions whether it has jurisdiction to hold beyond the matter being stipulated to.</p>\n    <p id=\"b28-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>As to the third issue, if a defendant has reason to believe that his imprisonment is illegal he must apply for his release and not take it upon himself to terminate his incarceration by escaping. People v. Granger, 97 Cal. App.2d 11, 13, 217 P 2d 41. In People v Scherbing, 93 Cal App. 2d 736 , 743 , 209 P. 2d 976, 800, the court said:</p>\n    <p id=\"b28-3\">\"There are cases holding that one unlawfully confined who escapes from such confinement, where the confinement is without color of authority, does not violate a statute making it unlawful to 'escape' from prison. People v. Clark, 69 Cal. App. 520, 231 P. 590; People v. Ah Teung, 92 Cal 421, 28 P. 577, 15 L.R.A. 190. These cases, however, deal with situations where a person has been confined either without any authority at all or where the judgment was void on its face. But where the imprisonment is made under authority of law and the process is simply irregular in form, or the statute under which he is confined is unconstitutional, the escape is unlawful. People v. Ah Teung, 92 Cal. 421, 28 P. 577, 15 L.R.A. 190; People v. Howard, 120 Cal. App 45, 8 P2d176; People v. Belknap, 137 Cal. App. 366, 30 P. 2d 576; People v. Crider, 76 Cal. App. 101, 244 P. 113; People v. McPheeley, 92 Cal. App. 2d. 589, 207 P2d 651. This is likewise the general rule in other states. Kelley v. Meyers, 124 or. 322, 263 P. 903; People ex rel. Haines v. Hunt, 229 App. Div. 419, 242 N.Y.S. 105. It is also the view adopted by the federal courts. Aderhold v. Soikau, 5 Cir., 67 F.2d 259; Giese v. United States, 79 U.S. App. D.C. 126, 143 F2d 633; Bayless v. United States, 9 Cir., 141 F2d 578; certiorari denied 322 US. 748, 64 S. Ct. 1157, 88 L. Ed. 1580. To allow prisoners to use force to escape and then to permit the defense that they were unlawfully confined, would create chaos in a prison.\"</p>\n    <p id=\"b28-5\">It is true that the record does not reveal an order transferring defendant from the Agana Lock-Up to the Guam Penitentiary. How and under whose direction defendant was transferred to the Penitentiary prior to October 11, 1977 remains a mystery. However, it cannot be contended that defendant's incarceration at the Penitentiary was wholly without color of authority since defendant's initial confinement at the Agana Lock-Up on July 30, 1977, was pursuant to a court order. Therefore, the court finds that defendant's incarceration was at all times under color of authority and that his subsequent order-less transfer to the Penitentiary was simply irregular in form which did not justify his escaping from there.</p>\n    <p id=\"b28-6\">For the foregoing reason, IT IS THE DECISION of the Court that defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment be and hereby DENIED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

This decision is based on the pleadings and oral argument presented to the court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b54-14\">Defendant's argument that this action is barred by res judicata is unfounded. In the debtor examination proceeding cited by defendant, Judge Raker had to accept defendant Pope's statement that he had no debt owing Pithree Farms, Inc. Said examination was not a trial and the findings there were not a judgment subject to res judicata. Where a defendant denies a debt, the judge has no power to enter a summary order or judgment adjudicating the validity of the claim. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>adjudication must be made in an independent action. Bunnell v. Wynns, 13 CA. 2d 144, 56 P.2d 267 (1936).</p>\n    <p id=\"b55-3\">Defendant's argument that the statute of limitations has run is also unfounded. Defendant states that the stock subscription agreement was entered in 1972. But defendant never states when the agreement was to be performed. It is the breach of performance that starts the statute running, not when the agreement is entered. Where no date is set out in a stock subscription agreement, the performance is based on a \"call\" by the corporation. No facts setting forth a date of performance have been offered; thus the court cannot find that this action is barred by the statute of limitations. See, Spencer v. Anderson, 193 C. 1, 222 P. 355 (1924).</p>\n    <p id=\"b55-4\">The court finds that there is a triable issue of fact, which is whether or not defendant has an outstanding debt owing Pithree Farms, Inc., the plaintiff's debtor. This question has not been litigated.</p>\n    <p id=\"b55-5\">For the above reasons, the court DENIES the motion for summary judgment.

U.S. Public Law 94-385 provides for an appropriation to fund grants for state offices of consumer services to be granted to the various states and territories.</p>\n    <p id=\"b139-4\">2.

Without the account number prayed for by Petition, Petitioner cannot receive the money appropriated and granted to Guam by the U.S. Department of Energy and without said money the Office of Consumer Services as described in Public Law 94-385 would not be able to function in Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b139-8\">6.

Plaintiff then orally moved the court to prohibit the Government from using any information which the defendant was precluded from using pursuant to order of the court dated September 11, 1979. Upon hearing all the oral arguments of both parties, this court ruled to reserve decision. This court will now consider each motion separately.</p>\n    <p id=\"b56-6\">DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO STRIKE The Government contends that its motion is supported by Rule 408 of the Rules of Evidence which prohibits the admission of evidence of compromise to prove liability. The Government further contends that such documents are hearsay, violate the Best Evidence Rule, and are not properly authenticated.</p>\n    <p id=\"b56-7\">Plaintiff, on oral argument, stated that the challenged documents were submitted for the purpose of estopping the Government from asserting as a defense the untimely filing of plaintiff's claim and action.</p>\n    <p id=\"b56-8\">This Court finds that Rule 408 creates an exception for the admissibility of evidence otherwise inadmissible if offered for purposes other than to prove liability. Plaintiff does not seek to establish that the documents of compromise are an admission of liability on the part of the Government, but merely that negotiations were ongoing they are admissible.</p>\n    <p id=\"b56-9\">The Court fails to find weight in the Government's remaining arguments. As to the issue of hearsay, the Court finds these documents to be non-hearsay. With regard to the Best Evidence argument, where an original is unobtainable, or within the control of the party opponent, the Rule creates an exception for the introduction of copy in lieu of the original.

The order reads:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"A62\">\". . .in the event that defendant fails to provide answers to those interrogatories that defendant previously responded to by answering 'N/A' or 'Not knowledgeable of the fact' on or before October 17, 1979, defendant shall be precluded from introducing the requested information in evidence for any purpose at the trial in this matter.\"</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b57-4\">This Court, after reviewing the order, agrees that the intent of said order is to provide a blanket prohibition on the use of any information not properly answered. At the time said order was issued, the Government did not make any objection to the blanket prohibition. It is now argued by the Government that it is not utilizing any information precluded by the order, but is relying only on information contained it its answer to the complaint. This Court believes that the order of September 11th clearly circumvents this argument, and that said order is an unconditional prohibition upon the Government from using any information relating to questions not properly answered.</p>\n    <p id=\"b57-5\">It is not beyond the discretion of this Court to interpret a summary judgment proceeding as part of the overall trial, and therefore to interpret such a prohibition as applicable to such proceeding. Having failed to provide proper answers to the requested interrogatories specifically relating to the \"Letter of Understanding\", this Court finds the Government is forthwith precluded from using such information in support of its motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b57-6\">Plaintiff's motion prohibiting defendant from using the information referred to is hereby GRANTED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b57-7\">Defendant's motion is DENIED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b57-8\">Plaintiff's motion is GRANTED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b57-9\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

S.C. Kress and Co., 348 U.S. 144, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1609 and 10 (1969) quoting the Advisory Committee Vote on the 1963 amendment to subdivision (3) of Rule 56.</p>\n    <p id=\"b132-3\">\". . .As the moving party, respondent had the burden of showing the absence of a genuine issue as to any material fact, and for these purpose the material it lodged must be viewed in the light most favorable to the opposing party.\" Adickes, Supra, at p.1608.</p>\n    <p id=\"b132-4\">Plaintiff relies on the matters deemed admitted by defendant's failure to respond to a Rule 36 request and plaintiff Stephanie Campbell's affidavit. It is well settled that admissions obtained under Rule 36, including matter deemed to be admitted by a party's failure to respond to a request for admissions, can form the basis for granting summary judgment, Moosman v. Joseph P. Blitz, 358 F.2d 686 (2d Cir. 1966); Jackson v. Riley Stoker Corporation, 57 F.R.D. 120 (E.D. Pa. 1972); O'Campo v. Hardisty, 262 F.2d 621 (9th Cir. 1958); Vilarosa v. Massachusetts Trustees of Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates, 39 F.R.D. 337 (E.D. Pa. 1966); See also 6 Moore's Federal Practice \u00a756.11(6).</p>\n    <p id=\"b132-5\">However a comparison of the allegations of the complaint which asserts in paragraphs six and seven that defendants knew the plaintiffs to be the owners of the rings in issue, and paragraph two of the admissions of defendant Roper to the effect that defendant Roper knew that a person working at Andersen Air Force Base had lost the rings and sought them, shows that the vital fact of knowledge of plaintiffs' ownership has not been admitted by defendant Roper. Also it is clear that none of the damages is established by the admissions.</p>\n    <p id=\"b132-6\">Thus the admissions cannot be deemed as having properly supported the motion.</p>\n    <p id=\"b132-7\">Next, plaintiff Stephanie Campbell's affidavit must be considered to see whether it shows the absence of a genuine issue of fact for trial. \"... Affidavits offered on a summary judgment motion are likely to be scrutinized carefully by the Court to evaluate their probative value and to determine whether they meet the standards prescribed by Rule 56(e) as to form and content...\" 10 Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a72722, p.484.</p>\n    <p id=\"b132-8\">In paragraph four of her affidavit, plaintiff asserts that on or after August 31, 1979, defendant became aware that the rings had been lost by plaintiff. As noted, defendant's awareness of the ownership of the rings is material to this action, but plaintiff's statement as to the fact of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>knowledge is simply conclusory. \"... Conclusory statements and statements not made on personal knowledge do not comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e) and therefore may not be considered.\" Union Ins. Soc. of Canton, Ltd v. William Gluckin and Co., CA 2d 1965, 353 P.2d 946, 952.</p>\n    <p id=\"b133-3\">Further, the fact that the rings found by defendant are plaintiffs' has not been proven to the Court. This is also clearly a material fact in issue.</p>\n    <p id=\"b133-4\">Before summary judgment can be granted it must be shown that the truth is quite clear to the Court, Sarton et al., v. Arkansas Nat. Gas Corp., 1944 64 S.Ct. 724 321 U.S. 620, 88 L. Ed. 967.</p>\n    <p id=\"b133-5\">The truth as to who owns the rings defendant found and the truth as to whether or not, if the owner is plaintiff, defendant knew of it before disposing of them, is not clear to this Court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b133-6\">Therefore the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b133-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Defendant was represented by Assistant Attorney General Richard Opper. Plaintiff was represented by David Dooley. The matter was regularly heard before Judge Paul J. Abbate, and decision was reserved.</p>\n    <p id=\"b101-13\">The basis of defendant's motion is that this action is barred by the Government Claims Act (\u00a76500 et. seq. of the Government Code, and hereafter referred to as the Claims Act), and must therefore be dismissed. Plaintiff responds that a plain reading of the Claims Act does not produce this result, and that if the Act is given the reading the Attorney General's Office urges, there are serious Constitutional questions regarding the validity of the Act.</p>\n    <p id=\"b101-14\">Defendant argues that Government Code \u00a76500.10 as amended by Public Law 13-116:6 forbids a suit against an individual once there has been a claim filed under the Act on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the same act or transaction. \u00a76500.10 states that the \"remedies provided by this chapter shall be exclusive\" and that \"No further or additional proceedings against the employee or employees, officer or officers, agent or agents, whose acts or omissions gave rise to the claim may be heard by any Court once a claim has been filed pursuant to this chapter.\" Defendant further argues that any reading of \u00a76500.10 which would not produce a bar to a second suit against the individual \"would nullify the basic premise of the Government's Limitations on Tort Liability [Government Code of Guam \u00a76500.13].\"</p>\n    <p id=\"b102-3\">A threshold question is whether there is a \u00a76500.13. As originally included in the Claims Act, \u00a76500.13 limited recovery to $10,000 in a wrongful death action and $25,000 in any other tort action. Public Law 12-26 made these limits respectively $35,000 and $100,000.00. Public Law 13-116:8 repealed and re-enacted \u00a76500.13, adding subsections 'a' and 'b' which dealt with government 'health care professionals' and moving the limits on recovery to subsection (c) without changing them. Public Law 13-116:8 expired by terms of Public Law 13-116:9 one year from its effective date. Thus as the act went into effect on December 24, 1975, Government Code \u00a76500.13 expired on December 24, 1976.</p>\n    <p id=\"b102-4\">On May 27, 1977 Public Law 14-29:6 purported to repeal the repealer clause of Section 9 of Public Law 13-116, but after it had already gone into effect. In Manisuban v. G.M.H., Superior Court of Guam Case No. 285-78 [2 Guam R. 63, 66], the Court in its Decision and Order of November 2, 1978 ruled that \"\u00a76500.13 was revived by Section 6 of Public Law 14-29.\", citing <em>1\u00c1 </em>Sutherland on Statutory Construction, Section 23.31 (3rd Ed.). The Court will follow this ruling in the present case, as the intent of the Legislature is clearly to revive \u00a76500.13.</p>\n    <p id=\"b102-5\">However, following this action the Fourteenth Guam Legislature once again attempted to affect Government Code \u00a76500.13. In Section 4 of Public Law 14-79 the Legislature purportedly amended Section 9 of Public Law 13-116 to read: \"The provisions of Section 8 shall expire June 30, 1978.\" Section 8 of Public Law 13-116 was, of course, the section which repealed and re-enacted the original Government Code \u00a76500.13. What is the effect of this statute?</p>\n    <p id=\"b102-7\">This Court has held that Public Law 14-29 repealed Section 9 of Public Law 13-116. Thus, Public Law 14-97:4 is a purported amendment of a repealed section.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b102-8\">[S]ince an amendatory act alters, modifies, or adds to a prior statute, all courts hold that a repealed act cannot be amended. No court will give the attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>amendment the effect of reviving the repealed act. 1A Sutherland Statutory Construction\u25a0 \u00a722.03.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b103-4\">The only remaining question is whether the amendment itself should be given any effect. Some jurisdictions give no effect to purported amendments to repealed statutes. Other courts \"recognize the mistake of the legislature and try to determine and give effect to its intent.\" Sutherland, supra, \u00a722.03. In this case, it is not necessary to try to place Guam in one school of thought or the other, for even should the court attempt to effect the intent of the legislature, it is impossible to ascertain what that intent was.</p>\n    <p id=\"b103-5\">In enacting Public Law 14-97:4, the Legislature was evidently unaware that it has previously revived Government Code \u00a76500.13 without a time limit by Public Law 14-29:6. The Legislature determined that it was better to revive \u00a76500.13 with a time limit of June 30, 1978 than to have no time limit at all. But the Court cannot say that the Legislature would have acted in the same manner if it had been aware that \u00a76500.13 had been revived by Public Law 14-29 without a time limit. It is a different decision to add to the Act, as the Legislature thought it was doing in Public Law 14-97 and to time limit the effect of the Act, as the Legislature was actually doing. Thus, it is the decision of this Court that Public Law 14-97:4 had no effect, and that \u00a76500.13 is operative.</p>\n    <p id=\"b103-6\">The validity of Government Code \u00a76500.13 is a prelude to deciding this motion, for Plaintiff relies on Government Code \u00a76500.20. As defendant noted in brief, prior to the enactment of Public Law 13-116, the limitations on actions were contained in Government Code \u00a76500.20, which provides: \"Settlement . . . or final judgment . . . shall bar the claimant from any further proceedings against the employee . . . unless: (b) the Court certifies that it would have awarded the claimant more but for the limitations of \u00a76500.13.\" Thus, if there still are limitations on the amount of recovery against the Government, it is plaintiff's argument that as the prayer in his suit against the Government is more than the amount of the limit, it is for the possibility of a recovery against the individual after certification under Government Code \u00a76500.20 that the instant suit is filed. \u00a76500.20 has not been amended since Public Law 9-175, the original Claims Act, and as the Harvard Student Legislative Reserach Bureau who drafted the Act put it in their official comments which were before the Ninth Legislature: \"if the claim is a large one, and the trial judge certifies that he would have awarded more but for the limitaitons of \u00a76500.13, the claimant may sue the employee for what is in effect a deficiency judgment.\"</p>\n    <p id=\"b104-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Defendants' reading of Government Code \u00a76500.10 produces a contradiction of \u00a76500.20. But the Legislature could have amended or repealed \u00a76500.20 when it enacted Public Law 13-116, and chose not to do so. \"In terms of legislative intent, it is assumed that whenever the Legislature enacts a provision it has in mind previous statutes relating to the same subject matter.\" Sutherland, supra, \u00a751.02. \"Statutes in pari materia, although in apparent conflict, are so far as reasonably possible construed to be in harmony with each other.\"</p>\n    <p id=\"b104-3\">Thus, before reading \u00a76500.10 as an absolute bar to suit against the individual, it is first the duty of the Court to seek a construction which does not contradict \u00a76500.20. If \u00a76500.10 is read to provide a stay in proceedings against an individual until the close of the Government Claims case (to await possible certification under \u00a76500.20) when it states that \"no further or additional proceedings against the employee or employees, officer or officers, agent or agents, whose acts or omissions gave rise to the claim may be heard by any Court once a claim has been filed pursuant to this Chapter.\", such a harmonious reading is possible. And such a reading does not violate the mandate of \u00a76500.10 that the Act be an \"exclusive\" remedy, for the suit against the individual is authorized by an a part of the Act. Such a reading also does not leave a plaintiff perhaps barred from initiating suit against the individual by the statute of limitations due to the lapse of time before a \u00a76500.20 certification of the right to proceed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b104-4\">Given this reading of the statutes, it is not necessary to reach plaintiffs arguments regarding the validity of the statutes if given the reading urged by defendant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b104-5\">The motion to dismiss is DENIED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Aguon could receive retirement benefits in excess to those which she would normally be legally entitled, due to the alleged misrepresentation of the Government of Guam <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Retirement Fund Officer. We REVERSE, based on the following analysis:</p>\n    <p id=\"b202-3\">First, it must be noted that even if we were to assume that the Retirement Fund Officer had ostensible authority to bind the Government of Guam, the figure which he gave the plaintiff was an \"estimate\" only. Therefore, it cannot be reasonably said that the representation was understood by either party to be binding on the government.</p>\n    <p id=\"b202-4\">Second, the Retirement Officer did not have ostensible authority to bind the government in this matter; only the Trustees of the Retirement Board have final authority to approve retirement benefits. See \u00a74221(4) of the Government Code of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b202-5\">Third, it is well settled that an agent of the government, even acting within the scope of his authority, cannot estop the government from asserting certain defenses. The plaintiff does not contend that she has a statutory right to receive the disputed amount, only that the requirements of the Guam Government Code should not apply to her because she was somehow misled. The effect of the Superior Court's Defcision and Order would be to destroy the plain requirements of <em>Guam's </em>Retirement Law and make them so malleable that they could be bent and twisted in every case where a claimant contends he or she was somehow misled by a government agent. Chaos would be the result of such a ruling which would no longer make a claimant responsible for correctly determining his or her benefits upon retirement.</p>\n    <p id=\"b202-6\">Finally, the finding of the Superior Court that the Retirement Board must approve an annuity payment before it can be implemented ignores the express provisions of \u00a74230(b) that retirement payments may be implemented prior to Board approval. Neither of the two disputed annuity figures were originally approved by the Board. Certainly in such an instance it cannot be stated as a legal proposition that \"two wrongs make a right.\"</p>\n    <p id=\"b202-7\">The January 19, 1978 Decision and Order of the Superior Court is reversed. As the abundant authority offered by the government makes clear, the recomputation of the plaintiff's annuity to $13,668.96 a year was legally correct and cannot be upset under any theory of promissory estoppel. At the time of plaintiff's retirement on April 30, 1976, she was entitled only to the annuity which the Board of Trustees of the Retirement Fund finally approved.</p>\n    <p id=\"b202-8\">Reversed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

D\u00e9la Rosa, was convicted by a jury on two counts of-murder, one count of attempted murder and three counts of robbery. On August 28, 1978, the</p>\n    <p id=\"b149-16\">Superior Court of Guam sentenced D\u00e9la Rosa to eighty years imprisonment plus two life terms to run consecutively. We find that the appellant's right to a fair trial was protected and that none of the arguments presented on appeal warrant reversal. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n    <p id=\"b149-17\">On the evening of March 29, 1978, just before dusk, the lifeless bodies of three Japanese women were found on Guam in the Two Lovers Point area. Two of the women, Akemi Yokozawa and Satomi Tanaka, were dead, and Makiko Yamada, the other, was seriously hurt. The women were kindergarten teachers in Japan, spending a holiday on Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b150-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Testimony of several witnesses established that the women were shopping and sightseeing during the morning of March 29, 1978 along the San Vitores Road area. They were seen at the Okura Hotel tennis courts where they stopped to buy soft drinks. A tennis professional at the hotel testified that the women were carrying only large bills. He also stated that a man arrived in a gold colored automobile and that Miss Yamada asked the man how far it was to Two Lovers Point.</p>\n    <p id=\"b150-3\">After being directed by a motorcycle policeman regarding the route to Two Lovers Point, the women continued walking on a road leading to Marine Drive. While on this road, it seems that the person Miss Yamada had spoken to at the tennis courts pulled up in his car and offered the women a ride. On the way to Two Lovers Point, Miss Yamada conversed with the driver, while her two friends sat in the back seat. Close to Two Lovers Point, the car turned down a jungle road and stopped. The women got out of the car and the man shot Akemi Yokozawa. Miss Yamada was then shot and discovered in critical condition early that night, near the bodies of her two companions.</p>\n    <p id=\"b150-4\">The prosecutor's case against Dela Rosa was based mainly on the testimony of Anthony Gumataotao, who stated that Dela Rosa had said he committed the crime and had given him (Gumataotao) some of the victims' money and possessions. He also testified that he and Dela Rosa destroyed some of the evidence of the crime and that they threw a gun and some gold necklaces into the jungle. The appellant argues that the Superior Court should have given his requested instruction on informant, informant-addict, accomplice, and immunity because Gumataotao was the original suspect in the case.</p>\n    <p id=\"b150-5\">It is true that all of the fruits of the crime were connected to Gumataotao before he implicated Dela Rosa. Certain items belonging to the victims were found at Gumataotao's house and he led the police to other items. However, there was no evidence presented to support the jury instructions which the defendant requested at trial.</p>\n    <p id=\"b150-6\">First, there was nothing in the record to show that Gumataotao was ever paid by the Government or that he had been promised immunity. In fact the evidence was to the contrary where Gumataotao stated that no promises were made to him and that he had no intention of collecting a reward in the case. (TR Volume IV, pages 133 and 175). Also, as the Government has pointed out, there was no evidence to suggest that Gumataotao aided or abetted the commission of the crime. See People v. Chapman, 209 P.2d 121, 131 (Calif. 1949); United States v. Miller, 499 F.2d 736, 740 (10th Cir., 1974).</p>\n    <p id=\"b150-8\">Admittedly, the credibility of Anthony Gumataotao's testimony was subject to question (as was brought out by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>defendant's counsel on cross examination). However, it was not plain error for the court to have refused an instruction which as not supported by the evidence. If defendant's counsel had wished to instruct the jury that the testimony of a possible suspect should be viewed with caution, he should have made such a request and fashioned his instruction along such lines, supported by citation. Although appellant argues that On Lee v. United States, 343 U.S. 747, 72 S.Ct. 967, 96 is directly on point; it is not nor are the other cases which he cites.</p>\n    <p id=\"b151-3\">Next is is argued that a more specific instruction should have been given on eyewitness identification. While we agree that whether Miss Yamada could identify the defendant as her assailant was an important issue, the Ninth Circuit has held that whether or not to give the more general instruction is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. United States v. Mesterson, 529 F.2d 30 (1976). We find that the use of the more general instruction found in Devitt and Blackmar's Federal Jury Instructions, Instruction 15.18, adequately stated the law and was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    <p id=\"b151-4\">Appellant next argues that the admission of certain photographs of the murder victims were inflammatory and contained no probative value. As the Government points out, the victims in the instant case were fully clothed and were not mutilated or dismembered. Although the record is not entirely clear on this point, it seems that the trial judge did study the photographs as they were being held by the witness. We cannot say that as a matter of law the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting the photographs in question because it seems that they were helpful in presenting the testimony of the medical expert. (TR Volume I, page 69). See e.g. State v. Martinez, 439 P.2d 691, 696 (Idaho, 1968).</p>\n    <p id=\"b151-5\">The remaining issues presented on appeal can be dealt with summarily. The fact that the defendant had expressed a fondness for the murder weapon several weeks before the murders and had tried to acquire it was relevant and the probative value outweighed any prejudice which appellant says resulted. See e.g. U.S. v. Leonard, 445 F.2d 234 (D.C. Cir., 1971) where it was held that evidence of one crime leading to the commission of another crime can be admitted. Also, while we don't necessarily approve of the prosecutor's personal comments against defendant's counsel during closing argument, it was up to defense counsel to ask that the jury disregard these comments. Also', the record does not support appellant's contention that there should have been a change of venue. Appellant admits that the jury stated that it could put aside any publicity and render a fair and just verdict. Finally, whether or not to admit the testimony of Frank Ishizaki <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>regarding ballistics was within the sound discretion of the trial judge and we find no error.</p>\n    <p id=\"b152-3\">Affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Fred Bordallo, Esquire, appeared for the defendants.</p>\n    <p id=\"b32-11\">The fact which are undisputed are that in February 1974 defendants contracted with Tom Tang and Carl Gutierrez and their respective construction companies as a joint venture to undertake a certain project at the Micronesia Hotel. Later, in September 1974, an agreement was reached whereby plaintiff paid $30,000.00 to Tang as payment for incurred expenses of Sang Feng. It is agreed that this payment was known to plaintiff Gutierrez.</p>\n    <p id=\"b32-12\">It is the effect of the payment to Sang Feng, and the agreement, if any, between plaintiff and defendant at this time, which is disputed by the parties.</p>\n    <p id=\"b32-13\">Plaintiff alleges in his counter-affidavit that at the September meeting, defendant and he agreed that, although Sang Feng Construction would be released by the $30,000.00 payment, he (plaintiff) would remain ready to perform and the contract would remain in effect between plaintiff and defendant. Tom Tang's affidavit contains the same statements as plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>regarding the nature of the agreement among plaintiff and defendant and himself.</p>\n    <p id=\"b33-3\">Defendants claim that the agreement with Tom Tang represented a release by the joint venture of all defendants' obligations under the contract in question. In attorney Bordallo's affidavit filed with the motion, he asserts first in paragraph three, that plaintiff at the September meeting agreed to accept as full settlement, the payment of any loss determined by negotiation between defendant Paul Bordallo and Tom Tang; and in paragraph six, that the sum of $30,000.00 was paid to Sang Feng Construction. (It is noted that Attorney [Fred] Bordallo was present at the meeting and has personal knowledge of the event). Thus it is claimed no further obligation exists on defendant's part.</p>\n    <p id=\"b33-4\">The Court requested additional memoranda from the parties on the effect on a joint venture contract when one of the joint venturers is released by the other party to the contract. However, before reaching this question of law, the Court must resolve the clear factual dispute presented by the affidavits, and that cannot be done in a summary judgment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b33-5\">Therefore, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b33-6\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

PERVO PAINT COMPANY, GRAND INTERNATIONAL INC., AND DOE I - X, Defendants</parties>\n  <docketnumber id=\"b37-11\">Civil No. 899-79</docketnumber>\n  <court id=\"Ahb\">Superior Court of Guam</court>\n  <decisiondate id=\"Amg\">May 1, 1980</decisiondate>\n  <opinion type=\"majority\">\n    <author id=\"b38-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>RAKER, Judge</author>\n    <p id=\"b38-3\">DECISION AND ORDER</p>\n    <p id=\"b38-4\">The above entitled matter came on for hearing on Defendants' motions to quash summons for lack of jurisdiction on.March 20, 1980, before the Honorable Judge John P. Raker. Briefs and supporting documents were filed. Robert Klitzkie appeared for Defendant, PERVO PAINT COMPANY, and Nancy Nye appeared for defendant, GRAND INTERNATIONAL, INC. Plaintiff appeared through counsel, Matthew Gruskin. Court ruled to take judgment under advisement.</p>\n    <p id=\"b38-5\">The Court will rule on both motions in this order, which are based substantially on the same facts.</p>\n    <p id=\"b38-6\">Both defendants argue that they are not amenable to this Court's jurisdiction under \u00a7406.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure because neither parties have been \"doing business\" on Guam sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction on them.</p>\n    <p id=\"b38-7\">The issue of in personam jurisdiction over a non-resident corporation has been dealt with extensively by the United States Supreme Court. In its decision from the landmark case of International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945) tEe Supreme Court stated that \"... due process requires only that he (the defendant) have certain minimum contacts with (the forum state) such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\" The Court reamplified its decision towards expanding the power of state courts to take jurisdiction over nonresident corporations in the subsequent decisions of McGee v. International Life Insurance Co., 355 U.S. 220, 2 L.Ed. 223, and again in Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 2 L.Ed. 1283. Minimum contacts with the forum state still remains the prerequisite test.</p>\n    <p id=\"b38-9\">The California courts have been more liberal in their interpretation of the Supreme Court's \"minimum contact\" decisions. The leading case in California on the issue is Buckeye Boiler Co. v. Superior Court, 71 C.2d 893, 80 Cal.Rptr. 113 (1969). Buckeye clarified \u00a7411(2) C.C.P., which is identical to Guam's former \u00a7406.1 C.C.P. The Court stated that as a matter of commercial actuality \"a manufacturer engages in economic activity within a state . . . whenever the purchases or use of its product within the state generates gross income . . . and is not so fortuitous or unforeseeable as to negative the existence of an intent . . . to bring about this result.\" Soon after, and in a response to Buckeye, the California legislature repealed \u00a7411(2) and enacted a new \u00a7410.10 of the Code of Civil Procedure which is commonly referred to as California's \"long arm statute\". California may now reach out and take jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant where to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>so would not violate the Constitution of the United States or the State of California.</p>\n    <p id=\"b39-3\">With all this recent trend towards opening the limits of jurisdiction Guam has been struggling with the confusion of former \u00a7406.1 Code of Civil Procedure with little success. The Fifteenth Guam Legislature recently passed Public Law 15-69 which has repealed \u00a7406.1 Code of Procedure effective October 1979, and updated our statutes similar to California's revision. For the purpose of this decision we must construe the law in effect at the time this suit was filed, which is under the old \u00a7406.1 Code of Civil Procedure, and disregard any interpretation that the new \u00a7406.1 can be applied retroactively to this case.</p>\n    <p id=\"b39-4\">While \"minimum contacts\" remains the prerequisite test under the Supreme court rulings, former \u00a7406.1 Code of Civil Procedure speaks in terms of \"doing business\" on Guam, and our focus must be addressed towards the language and validity of the statute.</p>\n    <p id=\"b39-5\">In case of Nanette Magallano v. The Firestone Tire and Rubber Co., Civil Case No. 444-77 the Superior Court of Guam upheld the validity of former \u00a7406.1 Code of Civil Procedure as a proper procedure for serving a nonresident corporation, thereby conferring upon it the jurisdiction of Guam's courts. The remaining issue then is whether either defendants were \"doing business\" on Guam within the meaning of former \u00a7406.1 Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n    <p id=\"b39-6\">There is no exact test for determining whether or not a nonresident defendant is doing business on Guam. It is the combination of local activities, their manner, extent and character which determines the issue of jurisdiction. It must be shown that the nonresident defendant \"maintained a representation which gave it in a practical sense, and to a substantial degree, the benefits and advantages it would have enjoyed by operating through its own office.\" Reeder Contractors of Arizona v. Higgins Ind., 265 F.2d 768 (CA9 1959). The court must consider (1) has the nonresident defendant through his acts purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state, (2) does the claim arise out of, or result from the defendant's forum-related activities, and (3) will the exercise of jurisdiction be reasonable so as not to offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.</p>\n    <p id=\"b39-7\">As shown from the affidavits filed by both sides, defendant, GRAND INTERNATIONAL, was a wholesale contractor for plaintiff. After several months of negotiations and representations, some of which included visits by GRAND into Guam, plaintiff was able to secure the purchase of PERVO paints. At all times GRAND was acting as a wholesale dealer for plaintiff, and even after the paint proved unsatisfactory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>GRAND continued to coordinate correspondences between PERVO and plaintiff to cure the defect. Defendant has shown to a substantial degree, that it intended by its acts to engage in business activities on Guam such that economic benefit would be derived. While GRAND does not claim to have any office on Guam, sales representative, or advertising outlet here, its acts throughout the entire length of this case demonstrates GRAND intended to engage in business activities with the resident plaintiff. In Island Equipment Company v. Teledyne Isotopes, Inc., Civil Case No. 713-78, the Superior Court upheld the jurisdiction over a California corporation upon facts similar to the instant case involving GRAND. This Court, therefore, concludes that GRAND'S actions have made it amendable to the jurisdiction of Guam's courts.</p>\n    <p id=\"b40-3\">As regards the acts of defendant, PERVO PAINTS, INC., this Court does not reach the same conclusion. Plaintiff states that PERVO is subject to jurisdiction based on the fact it knew the paints were being shipped to Guam, and that upon learning of the defective condition of the paints it made several direct communications with plaintiff to correct the problems.</p>\n    <p id=\"b40-4\">Nowhere has this court found that the mere knowledge one's product will be shipped to a particular state is sufficient to conclude that the corporation has thereby availed itself of the privilege of doing business in that state. PERVO'S knowledge alone does not lead this Court to conclude PERVO was engaged in any kind of substantial activity within our jurisdiction.</p>\n    <p id=\"b40-5\">With regard to the several direct correspondences with plaintiff, this Court generally agrees with the favored position that compromises and negotiations should be encouraged to adjust any difficulties arising in a contract. 15 Cal. Jur. \u00a7380. Imposing jurisdiction upon a nonresident defendant based on the fact the defendant has made several efforts to remedy a defect would tend to chill the purposes behind compromise. The Court cannot conclude that the efforts of PERVO to cure the defects in the paints, without more, is sufficient to show PERVO was \"doing business\" on Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b40-6\">Based upon the above discussion, it is ordered that service of process be quashed in favor of PERVO PAINT, INC., and upheld against GRAND INTERNATIONAL.</p>\n    <p id=\"b40-7\">Motion to quash for PERVO PAINT, INC., GRANTED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b40-8\">Motion to quash for GRAND INTERNATIONAL, DENIED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b40-9\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Section 28.50 of the Code provides in relevant part:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b162-14\">A person is guilty of a misdemeanor if he knowingly or recklessly:</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b162-15\">(h) performs an obscene act or otherwise presents obscene exhibition of his body in a public place.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b162-16\">The following facts were adduced at trial:</p>\n    <p id=\"b162-17\">On or about February 10, 1978, at approximately 1:05 p.m., a Mr. Duran of the Department of Public Safety Vice Division had gone with an Officer Sab\u00edan to the Sandy You Club in Tamuning. After entering the club, Duran and Sab\u00edan sat at a table which was located approximately ten to fifteen feet in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>front of a large, well-lit stage. Appellant was dancing nude on the stage. In response to the government's questioning, Duran testified that he observed the following:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b163-3\">Q. What did you observe Miss Daly do on the stage?</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b163-4\">A. She was dancing nude, and she exposed herself.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b163-5\">Q. In what way?</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b163-6\">A. Well, she was laying on the stage on her side, and she lifted one of her legs way up in the air, and with hands, she parted her labia, exposing the inner section.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b163-9\">Q. Did she do anything else?</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b163-10\">A. She was gyrating her pelvis in and out.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b163-11\">Reporter's Transcript, pp.6-7.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b163-12\">Duran attempted to photograph appellant's performance. He was prevented from doing so by one of the club's waitresses, who informed him that taking pictures in the club was not permitted. Duran then placed appellant under arrest.</p>\n    <p id=\"b163-13\">In this appeal, appellant contends: (1) that Guam Criminal and Correctional Code \u00a728.45 and \u00a728.50 are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and the prosecution of the appellant thereunder violated her constitutional right to due process of law; and (2) the evidence presented against appellant was insufficient to sustain a conviction because the government failed to produce any evidence of the community standards of Guam; and (3) the evidence presented was insufficient to sustain a conviction because the jury was deprived of the opportunity to consider appellant's performance as a whole in reaching its determination as to whether or not she violated Guam's obscenity law.</p>\n    <p id=\"b163-15\">Upon review of appellant's contentions, we find no basis for reversal, and accordingly AFFIRM the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b163-16\">I</p>\n    <p id=\"b163-17\">We note first that obscenity can manifest itself in conduct as well as through means of verbal and pictorial expression, Kaplan v. California, 93 S. Ct. 2680, 2683-2684 (1973), and that States have greater power to regulate nonverbal, physical conduct than to suppress depictions or descriptions of the same behavior. Miller v. California, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 2616 n. 8 (1973), see also United States v. O'Brien, 88 S. Ct. 1673, 1679 (1968). We also recognize that the search for guidance in separating unprotected obscenity from other sexually oriented but constitutionally protected forms of expression has historically been one of the more difficult tasks of reviewing courts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In Miller v. California, supra, the Supreme Court enunciated a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>comprehensive definition of obscenity, and provided new criteria applicable to suppression of the obscene.</p>\n    <p id=\"b164-3\">The constitutional standards provided in Miller and its attendant cases are those which are applicable to the issues raised in this appeal, and it is on this basis that we proceed in our review of appellant's contentions.</p>\n    <p id=\"b164-4\">II</p>\n    <p id=\"b164-5\">Appellant first makes a broad attack on Guam Criminal and Correctional Code \u00a728.45 and \u00a728.50, alleging that they are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b164-6\">Section 28.45 of the Guam Criminal and Correctional Code states:</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b164-8\">a. Any material or performance is obscene if considered as a whole, applying contemporary community standards:</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b164-9\">1. its predominant appeal is to prurient interest;</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b164-10\">2. it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in the description or representation of nudity, sex or excr\u00e9tion; and</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b164-11\">3. it is utterly without redeeming social importance.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b164-12\">b. In a prosection under this article, the question whether the predominant appeal of material or of a performance is to prurient interest shall be determined with reference to average adults, unless it appears from the nature of the material or performance, or from the circumstances of its dissemination, distribution, or exhibition, that it is designed for a clearly defined deviant sexual group or for children, in which case the question of predominant appeal shall be determined with reference to the intended recipient group.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b164-13\">c. When circumstances of production, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material or a performance is being exploited by the defendant for the sake of its prurient appeal, evidence of such circumstances is admissible in a prosecution under this article upon the upon question whether the material or performance is utterly without redeeming social importance.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b164-14\">d. Neither the prosecution nor the defense shall be required to introduce expert witness testimony concerning the obscene character of the material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>or performance which is the subject of a prosecution under this article.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b165-3\">Section 28.50 of the Guam Criminal and Correction Code states:</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b165-4\">A person is guilty of misdemeanor if he knowingly or recklessly:</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b165-5\">a.sends or brings any obscene material into this territory for sale or distribution;</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b165-6\">b. prepares, published, prints, exhibits, distributes, or offers to distribute any obscene material;</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b165-7\">c. possesses any obscene material with intent to distribute it is violation of this article;</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b165-8\">d. sells advertises or disseminates material, whether or not obscene, by advertising, representing or suggesting that is is obscene;</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b165-9\">e. presents or directs an obscene performance or participates in that portion thereof which makes it obscene; or</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b165-10\">f. distributes or sends to, or exhibits or offers to distribute any obscene material to a minor under the age of eighteen years;</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b165-11\">g. employs or uses a minor under the age of eighteen years to do or assist in doing any of the acts described in this section; or</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b165-12\">h. performs an obscene act or otherwise presents an obscene exhibition of his body in public place.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b165-13\">In Miller, the Court stated that:</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b165-14\">. . . we now confine the permissible scope of . . . regulation to works which depict or describe sexual conduct. That conduct must be specifically defined by the applicable state law, as written or authoritatively construed (footnote omitted). A state offense must also be limited to works which, taken as whole, appeal to the prurient interest in sex, which portray sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and which, taken as a whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b165-15\">The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether \"the average person, applying contemporary community standards\" would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (citations omitted); (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b166-3\">Miller v. California, supra at 2615.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b166-4\">Before proceeding to appellant's Miller-based contentions, we. observe that the Court expressly provided that it did not adopt as a constitutional standard the \"utterly without redeeming social value\" test (cf. part (c) of the Miller test), incorporated in part three of the test articulated in Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 86 S. Ct. 975, 977 (1966), and provided in \u00a728.45(a)(3) of the Guam Criminal and Correctional Code.</p>\n    <p id=\"b166-6\">A year after Miller was decided, in Hamling v. United States, 94 S. Ct. 2887 (1974), the Court was presented with the question of whether its rejection of the third part of the Memoirs test and its revision in Miller indicated that the Memoirs formulation was determined to be unconstitutionally vague. Memoirs was not rejected because it was so vague as to deprive criminal defendants of adequate notice but because it represented a departure from prior definitions of obscenity<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and because it imposed a prosecutorial burden virtually impossible to discharge, and which was not constitutionally required. The Court concluded:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b166-10\">Since Miller permits the imposition of a lessor burden on the prosecution in this phase of the proof of obscenity than did Memoirs, <em>and since </em>the basis of an instruction concededly based on the Memoirs test, petitioners derive no benefit from the revision of that test in Miller.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b166-11\">Id. at 2907.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b166-12\">In Marks v. United States, 97 S. Ct. 990 (1977), referring to the third part of the Memoirs test the Court added that \"clearly it was thought that some conduct which would have gone unpunished under Memoirs would result in conviction under Miller.\" Id. at 994. The petitioners in Marks were indicted for conduct occurring prior to the decision in Miller. Because of this, the Court reasoned that they were entitled to jury instructions requiring the jury to acquit unless it found that the materials involved in the charge were, in accordance with the Memoirs standard, \"utterly without redeeming social value.\"</p>\n    <p id=\"b166-14\">Because the tantamount language \"utterly without redeeming social importance\" is expressly a part of the Guam statute, the trial judge in the instant case was required, as was the trial judge in the instant case was required, as was the trial judge in Marks, to instruct the jury on this standard. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>The transcript indicates that the necessary instruction was so given:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b167-3\">In order to find that live conduct is obscene, each of the following elements must be proved, and there are five:</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b167-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b167-5\">And five, it is conduct which, taken as a whole is utterly without redeeming social value or importance.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b167-6\">The term utterly without redeeming social value or importance, as used in these instructions, means that the alleged obscene matter must be totally devoid of any redeeming literary, scientific of artistic value or any other of social importance.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b167-7\">The determination of whether matter is obscene is not to be made by weighing its social value or importance against its alleged prurient appeal for it is not obscene unless it is utterly without social value or importance.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b167-8\">In determining the question of whether the alleged obscene live conduct is utterly without redeeming social importance, you may consider the circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution or publicity, and particularly, whether such circumstances indicate that the live conduct was being commercially exploited by the defendant for the sake of its prurient appeal. Such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the conduct and can justify the conclusion that the conduct is utterly without any redeeming social importance. The weight, if any, to which such evidence is entitled is a matter for you to determine.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b167-9\">Reporter's Transcript, pp. 7, 9-10.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b167-10\">With receipt of the above instructions, the jury was sufficiently appraised of the more restrictive burden on the government than that required by Miller. Accordingly, we find that appellant suffered no loss by use of the \"social importance\" standard in \u00a7\u00a728.45(a)(3) and 28.45(c) of the Guam Criminal and Correctional Code.</p>\n    <p id=\"b167-11\">Ill</p>\n    <p id=\"b167-12\">We now turn to appellant's contention that Guam's obscenity statute fails to comply with the specificity requirements of Miller v. California and is therefore unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n    <p id=\"b167-13\">The second part (part (b)) of the Miller guidelines for the trier of fact in determining what is patently offensive is \"whether</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b167-14\">(a) Patently offensive representation or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts normal or perverted, actual or simulated.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b168-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>(b) Patently offensive representation or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b168-3\">Id. at 2615.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b168-4\">Section 28.50 of the Guam Code provides that a person is guilty of a misdemeanor if he:</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b168-5\">e. presents or directs an obscene performance or participates in that portion thereof which makes it obscene; or</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b168-6\">h. performs an obscene act or otherwise presents an obscene exhibition of his body in a public place.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b168-7\">Appellant argues that the examples set forth in Miller describe sexual conduct while the Guam statute does not provide any definition or any example of what forms of sexual conduct are being regulated.</p>\n    <p id=\"b168-8\">While there can be no question that Miller requires sexual conduct to be specifically defined by the applicable law, we believe that appellant misconceives the exactitude with which such specificity is to be defined. In Miller and Handing, the Court reiterated its pronouncement in Roth v. United States, 77 S. Ct. 1304 (1957):</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b168-9\">\"Many decisions have recognized that these terms of obscenity statutes are not precise. This Court, however, has consistently held that lack of precision is not itself offensive to the requirements of due process. '...[T]he Constitution does not require impossible standards; all that is required it that the language conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices. ...' United States v. Petrillo, 332 U.S. 1, 7-8, 67 S. Ct. 1538, 1542, 91 L.Ed. 1877. These words, applied according to the proper standard for judging obscenity ... give adequate warning to conduct proscribed and mark <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>... boundaries sufficiently distinct for judges and juries fairly to administer the law...' Id., 332 U.S., at page 7, 67 S. Ct. at page 1542.\" 354 U.S., at 491-492, 77 S. Ct. at 1312 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b168-11\">Miller v. California, supra at 2617, n. 10.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b168-12\">Handing v. United States, supra at 2904.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b168-13\">In United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film, 93 S. Ct. 2665 (1973), decided the same day as Miller, the Court said:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b169-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>... If and when such a \"serious doubt\" is raised as to the vagueness of the words \"obscene,\" \"lewd,\" \"lascivious,\" \"filthy,\" \"indecent,\" or \"immoral\" as used to describe regulated material... we are prepared to construe such terms as limiting regulated material to patently offensive representations or descriptions of that specific \"hard core\" sexual conduct given as examples in Miller v. California, supra, 413 U.S., at 25, 93 S. Ct. at 2615.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b169-3\">Id. at 2670, n. 7.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b169-4\">The Court in Hamling reconfirmed its renunciation of a rigid standard:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b169-5\">. . . while the Court in Miller did refer to \"specific prerequisites\" which \"will provide fair notice to a dealer in such materials,\" 413 U.S., at 27, 93 S. Ct. at 2616, the Court immediately thereafter quoted the language of the Court in Roth v. United States, 354 U.S., at 491-492, 77 S. Ct., at 1312-1313, concluding with these words:</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b169-6\">\"That there may be marginal cases in which it is difficult to determine the side of the line on which particular fact situation falls is no sufficient reason to hold the language to ambiguous to define a criminal offense...\" 413 U.S., at 28 n. 10, 93 S. Ct. at 2617.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b169-7\">The Miller cases, important as they were in enunciating a constitutional test for obscenity to which a majority of the Court subscribed for the first time in a numbers of years, were intended neither as legislative drafting handbooks or as manuals of jury instructions...</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b169-8\">Our reading of \u00a728.45 and \u00a728.50 in the light of the Court's statements in Roth, 12 200-ft. Reels and Hamling leads us to conclude that, although the language of the Guam obscenity statue is at variance with the guidelines set out verbatim in Miller, the language is sufficiently specific under Miller as to be absent of any constitutional defect.</p>\n    <p id=\"b169-9\">Appellant also contends that judicial interpretation of the Guam obscenity statute to include the Miller specificity requirements does not rectify the statute's unconstitutionality. The rationale for this proposition is that the Miller Court had included in its opinion language to the effect that\"... existing state statutes, as construed heretofore or hereafter, may well be adequate.\" Miller v. California, supra at 2615, n 6. Appellant argues that this reference to statutes \"existing\" at the time Miller was decided precludes judicial construction of statutes passed after the decision, and therefore Guam's statute, which had been passed approximately three years after Miller, is not capable of being \"saved\" by judicial construction.</p>\n    <p id=\"b170-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>We disagree with this inference drawn from the language cited in Miller. Immediately preceding the quoted sentence, the Court stated:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b170-3\">We do not hold . . . that all States <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> . . . . must now enact new obscenity statutes.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b170-5\">Id. at 2615, n 6.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b170-6\">It is evident that the Court felt existing state obscenity laws which were otherwise constitutionally valid would continue to be valid, either as written or construed, in the indeterminate future. We find that it would be inconsistent with notions of due process, and therefore inconceivable as in inference, to interpret the Court's meaning to be that an obscenity statute currently active in a State's law may or may not be constitutional, depending solely on whether it was enacted prior to or after the decision in Miller. While we acknowledge that the language of the Guam statute is in large part archaic, we do not find that it is on that basis alone unconstitutional.</p>\n    <p id=\"b170-7\">IV</p>\n    <p id=\"b170-8\">In an alternative context, appellant contends that even if judicial interpretation of the Guam obscenity statute to include the specificity requirements is valid, such construction does not cure the constitutional defect as applied to appellant. This contention is premised on the proposition that the Guam statute is facially defective, a proposition with which we are not in agreement. Nevertheless, a review and disposition of whether \u00a728.45 and \u00a728.50 are unconstitutional as applied to the specific conduct of appellant is appropriate here.</p>\n    <p id=\"b170-9\">It is notable that even appellant concedes that the Guam statute does forbid the presentation of an obscene performance (appellant's brief at p.5). The argument, however, is that the definition of obscenity under Miller is a completely separate requirement from the requirement of a specific definition of the sexual conduct being prohibited, and that any construction of the Guam statute to include the Miller specificity requirements is unconstitutional because the construction could only have been made subsequent to appellant's arrest.</p>\n    <p id=\"b170-10\">The question that must first be answered is whether the phraseology \"obscene act\" and obscene exhibition of his (sic) body\" was sufficient as notice to appellant that her conduct was proscribed. Only if it was not does the issue of statutory construction as applied to appellant's conduct become viable for review.</p>\n    <p id=\"b170-11\">We find that the language of the statute provided appellant with adequate notice of the illegality of her conduct, and that therefore it is not incumbent upon us to reach the propounded issue of whether the statute was unconstitutional as construed to apply to appellant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n    <p id=\"b171-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Section 28.50(h) of the Guam Criminal and Correctional Code, comprising the charge under which appellant was convicted, provides that a person is guilty of misdemeanor if he knowingly or recklessly:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b171-3\">(h) performs and obscene act or otherwise presents an obscene exhibition of his body in a public place.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b171-4\">In Hamling, the court stated that:</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b171-5\">The definition of obscenity ... is not a question of fact, but one of law; the word is not merely a generic or descriptive term, but a legal term of art. (citations omitted) . . . The legal definition of obscenity does not change with each indictment; it is a term sufficiently definite in legal meaning to give a defendant notice of the charge against him. (citations omitted) . . . the various component parts of the constitutional definition of obscenity need not be alleged ... in order to establish its sufficiency . . .</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b171-6\">Hamling v. United States, supra at 2908.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b171-7\">The use of the terminology \"obscene act\" and \"obscene exhibition\" is therefore sufficiently definite in legal meaning as to have provided appellant with notice of the charge against her. Accordingly, we conclude that the language of \u00a728.45 and \u00a728.50, and particularly that language of \u00a728.50(y), gave adequate notice to appellant that her conduct was within the prohibition of the statute.</p>\n    <p id=\"b171-8\">V</p>\n    <p id=\"b171-9\">Appellant's next contention is that the evidence presented against her at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction in that the Government failed to produce any evidence of the community standards of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b171-10\">In Re Giannini, 69 Cal. 2d 653, 72 Cal. Rptr. 655, 446 P.2d 535 (1968), cited by appellant in support of her argument, is inapposite to the current state of the law regarding \"contemporary community standards.\" Neither expert testimony on community standards, Hamling v. United States, supra at 2912-2914, nor instructions on precisely what \"community\" to consider, Jenkings v. Georgia, 418 U.S. 153, 157 (1974), are constitutionally required. Further the possibility that different juries might reach different conclusions as to the same material does not render a statute unconstitutional. Smith v. United States, 97 S.Ct. 1756, 1768 (1977).</p>\n    <p id=\"b171-11\">Regarding the \"contemporary community standards\" to be applied in judging appellant's conduct, the trial judge charged the jury as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b172-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>The contemporary community standards referred to in these instructions is set by what is, in fact, acceptable to the community as a whole, not by what some person or persons may believe the community as a whole ought to accept. Assertment of the standards must be based upon an objective determination of what affronts \u2022 and what is unacceptable to the community as a whole.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b172-3\">Your own personal, social or moral views on material such as that shown in the complaint may not be considered for purposes of determining the obscenity of the material here in question. The controlling community is the entire territory of Guam.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b172-4\">In that regard, you may consider evidence concerning the standards of any local community in Guam for such bearing, if any, as you may determine it has upon the question of what the territory-wide standard is. The standard of any such local community may not be taken, in and of itself, to establish the territory-wide standard, thought it may be considered as some evidence of what the territory-wide standard is.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b172-5\">We hold that this charge to the jury was sufficient and proper, and find no merit in appellant's attack on the failure of the Government to produce evidence of the community standards of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b172-6\">VI</p>\n    <p id=\"b172-7\">Appellant's final contention is that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction because the jury was deprived of the opportunity to consider appellant's performance as a whole in reaching its determination as to whether or not appellant violated Guam's obscenity law.</p>\n    <p id=\"b172-8\">Section 28.45(a) of the Guam Criminal and Correctional Code states:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b172-9\">a. Any material or performance is obscene if considered as a whole, applying contemporary community standards:</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b172-10\">1. Its predominant appeal is to prurient interest;</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b172-11\">2. It goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in the description or representation of nudity, sex or excretion; and</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b172-12\">3. It is utterly without redeeming social importance.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b172-13\">The Government's witness, Mr. Duran, admitted he did not see appellant's entire performance since he entered the Sandy You club after appellant had begun her dance. We also recognize that it is probable that appellant had not completed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>her performance; the arrest by Duran in all likelihood curtailed that possibility.</p>\n    <p id=\"b173-3\">From this admittedly partially-observed performance, appellant argues that it was impossible for Duran to describe appellant's entire performance to the jury and therefore, it was impossible for the jury to determine whether the performance, as a whole, was in fact obscene.</p>\n    <p id=\"b173-4\">The third criterion of Section 28.45(a) is that the performance must be \"utterly without redeeming social importance.\" We emphasize that the performance must not only have social importance to be constitutionally protected, but that the social importance must be sufficient to redeem the obscene, or unprotected part of the performance. Thus, even if appellant's performance opened with a Shakespearean recitation and climaxed with an aria from the \"Barber of Seville,\" a jury could nevertheless have found that, notwithstanding whatever social importance was gleaned from the entire performance, it was insufficient to redeem the obscene act or exhibition.</p>\n    <p id=\"b173-5\">As stated in Kois v. Wisconsin, 92 S.Ct. 2245, 2246 (1972), and cited in Miller v. California, supra at 2615:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b173-6\">A quotation from Voltaire in the flyleaf of a book will not constitutionally redeem an otherwise obscene publication.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b173-7\">When the verdict of a jury is challenged, the general rule of applicability is that its verdict must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it. Glasser v. United States, 62 S.Ct. 456, 468 (1942). Based on the evidence before it, the jury could have inferred that the appellant's performance would have been obscene irrespective of its context, and returned a verdict of guilty based on that inference. Because of this, we are not inclined to disturb the verdict as rendered.</p>\n    <p id=\"b173-8\">The judgment of the Superior Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b173-9\">Footnotes:</p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n      <p id=\"b173-10\">.

Pursuant to Government Code \u00a76500.15, trial was before the court, without jury.</p>\n    <p id=\"b13-7\">During the course of the trial, testimony of plaintiff's witnesses disclosed that at the time of the incident alleged in plaintiff's complaint, plaintiff was driving a car belonging to the Guam Power Authority, that his car was assigned to plaintiff for this work, and at the time of the incident, plaintiff was driving the car to its assigned parking space, pursuant to standing instructions of his employer, the Guam Power Authority, at the time of the incident upon which the complaint is based, plaintiff was within the scope of his employment. Plaintiff did not willfully cause his own injury.</p>\n    <p id=\"b13-8\">1 During the course of the trial, the plaintiff's proof having established that plaintiff was within the scope of his employment at the time of the incident, the court itself raised the issue of whether or not this action was barred under the Workmen's compensation Law, Government Code Sections 37000 et. seq. This was proper and appropriate, for, although such a defense is normally barred by Rules of Civil Procedure 8(c) if not pleaded, the defendant may, nonetheless, take advantage of the plaintiff's proof, and, if necessary, the court will raise the issue itself. See, 2A Moore's Federal Practice Paragraph 8.27 [3] and Wright, and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a71278. The Court asked for argument on this point and the issue was briefed. Clearly, plaintiff is covered by the Workmen's Compensation Law.</p>\n    <p id=\"b13-9\">This leaves, however, the question of whether or not the Government of Guam is a third party in relation to the plaintiff. If the Government of Guam is actually the plaintiff's employer, Government Code \u00a737005 bars this action. If plaintiff is not an employee of the Government of Guam, then \u00a737005 is no bar to this action. This much is clear, plaintiff is clearly an employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>of the Guam Power Authority. Therefore, the court must determine the relationship between the Guam Power Authority and the Government of Guam in order to determine the legal relationship between plaintiff and the Government of Guam. That is to say, if the Guam Power Authority is an agent of the Government of Guam, then plaintiff is an agent of the Government of Guam, the plaintiff is an agent of the Government of Guam, since a sub-agent, recruited by an agent with his principal's authority, is also an agent of the principal. Waggaman v. General Finance Co., 116 F.2d 254 (3rd Cir. 1940). The Guam Power Authority has specific authority to hire employees, Government Code \u00a721503(9) and 21512. (Certainly the statutes do not contemplate that the Board of Directors of the Authority will personally provide electric power.) It would thus appear that employees of the Guam Power Authority are employees of the Government of Guam, at least for some purposes. Pursuant to Government Code \u00a721509, the Authority is exempt from taxation. Employees of the Authority are members of the Government of Guam Retirement Fund pursuant to Government Code \u00a721512(b). This is all consistent with Authority employees being employees of the Government of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b14-5\">However, Government Code \u00a721502 is, at first blush, ambiguous. It reads as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b14-6\">\u00a721502. Establishment. There is within, and a public corporation and autonomous instrumentality of, the Government of Guam a Guam Power Authority.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b14-9\">2In determining whether or not agency relationship exists, control, or the right to control is considered. See, Restatement, Agency 2d, p. 485, sec. 220. If the Guam Power Authority is \"autonomous\" as set forth in \u00a721502, how can an agency relationship exist between it and the Government of Guam? Yet, the same \u00a721502 sets forth that the Guam Power Authority is an \"instrumentality\" of the Government of Guam. This is an apparent contradiction.</p>\n    <p id=\"b14-10\">It is unthinkable that the Legislature would have intended the Authority to be other than an instrumentality of the Government of Guam. Further language in \u00a721502 speaks of the Authority's being \"within the government\". With all the Authority's special privileges, which include exemption from taxation, government retirement benefits, etc., the Guam Power Authority Act of 1968 would clearly be void as violative of 48 U.S.C. \u00a71471 if the Authority were not within the Government of Guam. Where the court is faced with two interpretations, one of which would hold the statute wholly void and the other of which would uphold the statute, it is clear that the legislative intent must be the latter interpretations.</p>\n    <p id=\"b15-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Since the Guam Power Authority is definitely within and an instrumentality of the Government of Guam how is this to be squared with \u00a721502's provision for \"autonomy\"? It is clear that this autonomy is relative. Some cases would hold that such an agency is an executive agency over which the chief executive retains certain powers of direction. See Myers v. United States, 273 U.S. 52, 47 S.Ct. 21 (1926) and Morgan v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 115 F.2d 990 (6th Cir. 1940). However, it is unnecessary for the court to consider the question, as numerous examples of control by the Government of Guam, as a whole, exist, and these establish sufficient control by the Government of Guam over the Guam Power Authority to be consistent with an agency relationship, notwithstanding the word \"autonomous\" in \u00a721502. For example, the Civil Service Commission approves and the Governor promulgates the Guam Power Authority's personnel regulations under Government Code \u00a74004. The Governor nominates and appoints, with the advice and consent of the Legislature, the Guam Power Authority's Board of Directors pursuant to Government Code \u00a721504(a). The Legislature has exercised control over the Guam Power Authority by enacting the Guam Power Authority Revenue Bond Act of 1968 (Government Code Sections 21550-21591). The Legislature has power to enact further legislation affecting the Authority. The Authority's rate structure is subject to detailed regulations by the Public Utilities Commission pursuant to Government Code Sections 21000 et. seq. In brief, it is not necessary for the court to decide, and the court therefore does not decide, how much control the Executive Branch exercises over the Authority and how much control the Legislative Branch exercises. It is sufficient, and the court holds that the Executive and Legislative Branches exercise sufficient control, and have a right to sufficient control, to show an agency relationship between the Government of Guam and the Authority consistent with the words \"instrumentality\" and \"within .... the government\" and notwithstanding the word \"autonomous\", all contained in \u00a721502. The court need not and does not apportion that authority between the Legislative and Executive Branches. For all the above reasons, this court holds that plaintiff is an agent and employee of the Government of Guam and that this claim is, therefore, barred by operation of Government Code \u00a737005.</p>\n    <p id=\"b15-3\">Further, Government Code \u00a721512(c), which was passed as part of the Guam Power Authority Act of 1968, as originally passed, specifically states that the manager, secretary, treasurer, comptroller and attorney of the Authority are not within the classified service of the Government of Guam. Where it appears clearly from the tenor of the statute that employees of the Authority are employees of the Government, and the Legislature specifically exempts certain people from the operation of the statue, it is strong evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Legislature intended that all other employees be within the classified service or, at the very least, simply employees of the Government of Guam. Otherwise, Government Code \u00a721512(c) would serve no purpose.</p>\n    <p id=\"b16-3\">3It should be further noted that while Authority employees are covered by Workmen's Compensation, the benefits are actually paid from the Government of Guam's Workmen's Compensation Fund, Government Code \u00a721512(b). Although the Fund may recoup these payments from the Authority on an annual basis pursuant to this Section, the liability for Workmen's Compensation payments is upon the Government of Guam. This being the case, the Government of Guam cannot, as a matter of law, be a third party with respect to plaintiff. See, Brown v. Arrington Construction Co., 74 Idaho 338, 262 P.2d 789, dicta (1953). The case cited by plaintiff in this regard are unpersuasive. Thus, the bare fact that compensation to plaintiff under the Worlonen's Compensation Law would come from the Government of Guam's Workmen's Compensation Fund is sufficient to bar plaintiff's claim under Government Code \u00a737005.</p>\n    <p id=\"b16-4\">Although Government Code \u00a76500.10 speaks of suing the Government of Guam as the exclusive remedy, this is a law of general applicability. This Section does not, therefore, override the specific provisions of Government Code 37005 that make the Workmen's Compensation Law the exclusive remedy against the Government of Guam in some cases. See, 1A Sutherland, Statutory Construction Section 23.16. See also. Government Code \u00a76500.12.</p>\n    <p id=\"b16-5\">Judgment shall be for defendant.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Benson. Plaintiff was represented by David Dooley, and defendant was represented by Davor Pevec and Thomas Himrod. The Court ruled to reserve decision on the motion to quash.</p>\n    <p id=\"b117-5\">Plaintiff contends that \u00a76500.15 of the Government Code, which prohibits of jury trial in claims against the Government, is repealed by \u00a7680.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides for jury trial in \"all cases at law\" exceeding twenty dollars ($20.00).</p>\n    <p id=\"b117-6\">The general trend of authority is against an interpretation of repeal by implication. Where no inconsistency strong enough to evoke a repeal exists, a repeal by implication will not be found. It cannot be presumed that the legislature intended to undo or repeal an act to which it had but just assigned a valid function. People v. Fitzgerald, 14 Cal.App 2d 180 (1936) cert. den. 299 U.S. 593, 57 S.Ct. 115. Sutherland Statutory Construction, Vol. 1A Section 23.09.</p>\n    <p id=\"b117-8\">The presumption is that the legislature intended to achieve a consistent body of law. In the absence of an irreconcilable conflict, or where two provisions of legislation are so clearly repugnant as to vital matters which they relate, courts should construe all acts harmoniously where such construction is reasonably possible. Sutherland Statutory Construction, Vol. 1A Section 23.10.</p>\n    <p id=\"b117-9\">While there appears to be a conflict in consistency between the Claims Act and the Civil Procedure Code regarding jury trial, it does not appear so repugnant an inconsistency that the two provisions cannot stand together. A suit filed under the Claims Act is a very narrow and limited area for relief. The Government consents to be sued only as provided in the Act. It can not be easily construed in the absence of express language that the adoption of \u00a7680.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure necessarily implied a repeal of \u00a76500.15 of the Government Code.</p>\n    <p id=\"b118-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Given the above trend in statutory construction, and based on a reasonable reading of both sections together, this court grants defendant its motion to quash request for jury trial.</p>\n    <p id=\"b118-3\">The motion is GRANTED.</p>\n    <p id=\"Atq\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The Government of Guam appeared and objected to the granting of title on the grounds that there is encroachment on the government's land and the area claimed by appellant (petitioner) is 11.8 times larger that the tax roll area. The court below found that title to six hectares of land is vested in the appellant, while title to the remaining sixty-five hectares is vested in the government.</p>\n    <p id=\"b188-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>The trial court found that the map, introduced and admitted into evidence as appellant\u2019s Exhibit 1, was inadequate to support petitioner's claim because:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b188-3\">\". . . Petitioner did not produce the registered land surveyor under whose supervision the map was prepared and further failed to produce any witness familiar with the field notes for said survey.\"</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b188-5\">Appellant argues that this ruling constitutes error and contends that \"the lower court has disregarded the statutory prima facie finding of \u00a713809 of the Government Code of Guam which provides that where a map, sketch, or plat conforms with the provisions of \u00a713808, Government Code of Guam, which this map does, it is prima facie evidence of the facts represented thereon, without further proof.\"</p>\n    <p id=\"b188-6\">Appellant, however, chose to ignore other portions of \u00a713808 and has in fact closed its eyes to a very pertinent provision of that section which says in essence \"that no document purporting to establish title to land. . \u25a0. shall be 'filed unless accompanied by a map, . . . made within one year period . . . preceding the filing of the petition for land registration if said map were filed therewith.\"</p>\n    <p id=\"b188-7\">The petition was filed on July 26, 1973. The map attached to the petition was dated March 3, 1972 and bears a certification date of April 1, 1972. Clearly the map was not made \"within a one year period preceding the filing of the petition\" to which it was attached. The statutory prima facie finding of \u00a713809 is therefore clearly not applicable since the map attached to the petition was more than one year old and hence not in conformance with the requirement of \u00a713808, and [since] it no longer enjoyed the benefits of being prima facie evidence, the trial court did not err when it held that appellant's failure to produce the land surveyor under whose supervision the map was prepared rendered the map inadequate to support his claim to the entire seventy-one hectares.</p>\n    <p id=\"b188-8\">In any event, assuming arguendo, that the map should have been treated as prima facie proof of the facts represented thereon, it would have been proof of the description of the subject property \u2014 not necessarily of ownership.</p>\n    <p id=\"b188-9\">The trial court did make findings supporting the government's claim to ownership of the sixty-five hectares, designated as Lot 10139. Appellant has not argued that the findings were in error and accordingly this Appellate Court will not disturb the trial court's findings.</p>\n    <p id=\"b189-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>These findings would be sufficient to contradict and overcome the prima facie benefits of appellant's map even if it had met the one-year filing period requirement.</p>\n    <p id=\"b189-3\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

At issue are alleged irregularities occurring during grand jury proceedings consisting of discussions being held off-the-record.</p>\n    <p id=\"b157-7\">We hold that off-the-record discussions such as occurred here are prohibited in grand jury proceedings, and accordingly vacate the judgment of the Superior Court. The off-the-record discussions being sufficient grounds for reversal, we decline to reach the other issues raised in this consolidated appeal.</p>\n    <p id=\"b157-8\">Indictments dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n    <p id=\"b157-9\">The general rule regarding the recording of grand jury proceedings is that, in the absence of statute, the grand jury is not required to transcribe or record the proceedings brought before it. See, e.g. Robinson v. State of Alaska, 489 P.2d 1271 (1971), United States v. Trenary 473 F.2d 680 (1973). \"Though recordation of grand jury testimony is the better practice and is required by judicial order, such recordation is not mandated by (the United States) Constitution.\" United States v. Perkins, 383 F.Supp. 922 (1974).</p>\n    <p id=\"b157-10\">The departures from this rule and the variations thereof are many. In some jurisdictions it is required by statute that minutes of grand jury proceedings are to be kept, but are not to be revealed or to be made available, except to the court, prosecuting attorney, and persons to whom the court grants permission to inspect them, and, in the last instance, only upon notice to and after hearing the prosecuting attorney. 38 C.J.S. Grand Juries \u00a743 (1943). Elsewhere, a court may require production of minutes of grand jury proceedings upon a showing that there is a particularized need or compelling necessity for such disclosure. In re Grand Jury Investigation, 32 F.R.D. 175 (1963), cert. den. 84 S.Ct. 25 (1963).</p>\n    <p id=\"b157-11\">It has been held in at' least one jurisdiction that a criminal defendant is under certain circumstances constitutionally entitled to some part of a grand jury transcript, and that under its rule-making power a court may amend existing Criminal Procedure Rules to require the recording of all evidence before the qrand jury. McMahon v. Office of City and County of Honolulu, 465 P.2d 549 (1970).</p>\n    <p id=\"b158-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Some state legislatures have gone further than granting disclosure to facilitate pretrial preparation. For example, California Penal Code, \u00a7938.1, cited in McMahon, supra, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b158-3\">\"If an indictment has been found or accusation presented against a defendant, such stenographic reporter shall certify and file with the county clerk an original transcription of his shorthand notes and a copy thereof and as many additional copies as there are defendants. * * * The county clerk shall deliver the original of the transcript so filed with him to the district attorney immediately upon his receipt thereof, shall retain one copy for use only by judges in proceedings relating to the indictment or accusation, and shall delivery a copy of such transcript upon each such defendant or his attorney.\"</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b158-4\">The law in the Territory of Guam provides for equally liberal recordation and disclosure of grand jury proceedings, including the affirmative duty of delivering a copy of the original transcript to each defendant or his attorney. Similar to the provisions of the California Penal code cited in McMahon are those incorporated in Guam Criminal Procedure Code, \u00a7 50.38:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b158-5\">\"Section 50.38.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b158-6\">(a) If an indictment is returned against a defendant, the reporter shall transcribe the grand jury proceedings and shall certify and deliver to the clerk of the court the original transcript and a copy thereof for the prosecuting attorney and each defendant. The reporter shall complete such certification and delivery within ten days after the indictment is returned unless the court for good cause makes an order extending time. The clerk shall file the original transcript and immediately deliver a copy to the prosecuting attorney and to each defendant or his attorney. However, no copy shall be delivered to a defendant prior to his first appearance pursuant to Section 45.30. If the copy of testimony is not served as provided in this section the court shall on motion of the defendant continue the trial to such time as may be necessary to secure to the defendant receipt of a copy of such testimony ten days before such trial.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b158-7\">(b) The transcript shall not be open to the public until ten days after the delivery to the defendant or his attorney. Thereafter the transcript shall be open to the public unless the court orders otherwise on its own motion or on motion of a party pending a determination as to whether all or part of the transcript should be sealed. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the court determines that there is a reasonable likelihood that making all or any part of the transcript public may prevent a fair and impartial trail, that part of the transcript shall be sealed until the defendant's trial has been completed.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b159-3\">Thus, it is required in Guam that a transcript be made and that copies be provided for both the prosecuting attorney and each defendant. This being the law, we find merit in appellants' claim of possible prejudice arising from the failure of the Territorial Grand Jury to record all of the proceedings before them.</p>\n    <p id=\"b159-4\">The record on appeal does not disclose the contents of the discussion held off the record, or the circumstances attendant to that discussion.</p>\n    <p id=\"b159-5\">The government maintains that the indictments should not be dismissed because of two off-the-record discussions in the absence of a showing as to the nature of the discussions and prejudice accruing to the appellants. It is the government's impropriety in the proceedings as well as the prejudice resulting therefrom. But the statute is explicit in its statement that the grand jury proceedings are to be recorded, and no allowance is made for off-the-record discussions during the course of the grand jury proceedings. Granted, we are not able to say with any certitude that appellants were in fact prejudiced by these discussions. But we are not willing to speculate that they were not, nor should a defendant be asked to guess and be burdened with proving that he was.</p>\n    <p id=\"b159-7\">There is a certain danger in allowing off-the-record discussions to occur at any time and under any circumstances during official grand jury proceedings. If such discussions are allowed, it would be impossible for the defendant, or for a court sitting in review of alleged impropriety in the proceedings, to determine with specificity what testimony or other statements were considered in the return of an indictment. In People v. Pipes, 179 Cal. App. 2d 547 (1969), referring to the California statute which was in effect at the time of certain grand jury proceedings and the defendant's request for a copy of such proceedings, the court noted:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b159-8\">\"... that nowhere in the statute was it stated that only such testimony before a grand jury which was used as the basis for the return of the indictment should be reported and transcribed; that a defendant who has been indicted by a grand jury is entitled to have a transcript of the testimony of all witnesses who testified before it during the course of an investigation which culminated in the indictment; and that any evidence produced before and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>considered by the grand jury in returning and indictment must be reported and transcribed, and a copy thereof given to the defendant; and that it is not for the grand jury or the court to determine what testimony taken in the course of an investigation of a criminal cause was considered in returning an indictment respecting such cause.\"</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b160-3\">The language of the court in Pipes is equally appropriate to the matter now on appeal before this Court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b160-4\">The better practice is to record all proceedings had before the grand jury. In this respect, a 1977 decision from the Court of Appeals of Arizona is particularly instructive. In Wilkey v. Superior Court, 566 P. 2d 327 (1977), the court held that:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b160-5\">(1) all grand jury proceedings are to be recorded, except jury's deliberation but recording during formal recess is not required if recess is actually a hiatus in proceeding is which jurors do not discuss case with other; (2) no conversation is to be allowed between jurors and witnesses during recess; (3) no off-the-record conversation is to be allowed between jurors and prosecutors regarding the case or any legal aspect of it and (4) all actions of the prosecutor and jurors should be susceptible to review to insure defendant an impartial, just and unbiased hearing.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b160-6\">We adopt the holding of Wilkey. Further, while we are not aware of the nature of the off-the-record discussions, we find it necessary to add that, although it is the role of the prosecutor to draw such indictments as the grand jury directs, he may not give advice as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence in any matter, nor may he in any way seek to influence the grand jury to find or not to find any indictment, nor may he take part in any of the grand jury's deliberations, as these are all matters wholly within the exclusive province of the grand jury.</p>\n    <p id=\"b160-7\">Too often grand juries are criticized for being mere rubber stamps of the prosecution. Off-the-record discussions may lend credence to such criticism. The integrity of the grand jury system, however, is certainly enhanced by keeping the entire proceeding a matter of record.</p>\n    <p id=\"b161-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>For the above reasons, we dismiss without prejudice the indictments brought against appellants by the Grand Jury on February 8, 1979.</p>\n    <p id=\"b161-3\">INDICTMENTS DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.</p>\n    <p id=\"b161-4\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

CHASE MANHATTAN BANK, a national bank, Defendant</parties>\n  <docketnumber id=\"b51-7\">Civil No. 16-79</docketnumber>\n  <court id=\"ACo\">Superior Court of Guam</court>\n  <decisiondate id=\"A2G\">May 12 1980</decisiondate>\n  <opinion type=\"majority\">\n    <author id=\"b51-10\">BENSON, Judge</author>\n    <p id=\"b51-11\">DECISION</p>\n    <p id=\"b51-12\">The defendant's motion for summary judgment came before the court for oral argument on April 14, 1980, alleging that the action is barred by the statute of limitations. The parties appeared by counsel.</p>\n    <p id=\"b51-13\">The facts appear without dispute. On December 11, 1975, the action arose on an alleged breach of contract for the sale of, land. On January 13, 1976, the plaintiff filed its complaint in the District Court of Guam. The defendant moved for an order dismissing the complaint on the ground that the court lacked diversity jurisdiction. This motion was denied and the denial was affirmed in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>United States Supreme Court granted the defendant's petition for certiorari and reversed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b52-3\">In January, 1978, the plaintiff learned of the Supreme Court's opinion and assumed at that time that the case pending in the District Court of Guam would be dismissed in due time. On June 26, 1978, that dismissal was ordered by the District Court of Guam. On January 4, 1979, the present action, identical to that filed at the District Court, was filed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b52-4\">It appears undisputed that the statute involved is two years.</p>\n    <p id=\"b52-5\">In opposition to the motion to dismiss, the plaintiff seeks the equitable relief of the court to toll the statute during the time the action was pending in the District Court of Guam. If the statute is thus tolled, the time elapsed is eight months; one month from December 11, 1975 until January 13, 1976, plus seven months from June 26, 1978 until January 4, 1979.</p>\n    <p id=\"b52-6\">Without the tolling, over three years elapsed from the breach until the filing in this court. The defendant asserts that the statute should not be tolled since the plaintiff has not acted with diligence, in that twelve months elapsed from the time the plaintiff learned of the Supreme Court action until it filed here, and seven months elapsed from the time the District Court dismissed the case until the filing here. In no case cited by either party has the plaintiff delayed the refiling of the second case a comparable length of time.</p>\n    <p id=\"b52-7\">Two case were cited in which the doctrine of tolling was not permitted. In Central Bank, et al v. Transamerican Title Insurance Company, 85 Cal.App.3d 859, 149 Cal.Rptr. 822 (1978), the original action had been filed in Riverside County. When the plaintiff moved to file a second amended complaint, the court denied the request on the ground that the appellants had long known the facts underlying the additional causes of action set forth in the proposed second amended complaint. Since the court found that no diligence existed in filing the amended complaint in Riverside County, the statute of limitations was not tolled as to the second action filed in Alameda County. \"Since appellants did not timely present their causes of action in the Riverside action, the statute of limitations was not tolled in the Riverside action.\" 85 Cal.App. 3d, at p. 868.</p>\n    <p id=\"b52-8\">In Wood v. Elling Corporation, et al., 20 Cal.3d 353, 142 Cal.Rptr. 696, 572 P.2d 755 (1977), the original action had been dismissed because the complaint had never been served-The court held that the pendency of the first action did not toll the running of the statute, and the second action filed after the statutory period had run was time-barred. 20 Cal.3d, at p. 359.</p>\n    <p id=\"b52-9\">Two cases were cited in which the action was first filed in the federal court and then in the state court. Addison v. State of California, 21 Cal.3d 313, 146 Cal.Rptr. 224, 578 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>942 (1978) and Nicols v. Canoga Industries, 83 Cal. App. 3d 956, 148 Cal.Rptr. 459 (1978). In both cases the courts found that the action in the federal court tolled the statute of limitations and the actions in the state court was not time-barred.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b53-3\">\"As demonstrated by Bollinger and Elkins, application of the doctrine of equitable tolling requires timely notice, and lack of prejudice, to the defendant, and reasonable and good faith conduct on the part of the plaintiff.\" (Addison, supra, 21 Cal.3d, at p. 319)</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b53-4\">The court finds that insofar as the filing in the District Court is concerned, these criteria are met.</p>\n    <p id=\"b53-5\">The question remaining is whether or not when it became apparent that the District Court case was going to be dismissed and then later was in fact dismissed, the plaintiff acted with diligence. Nicols contains language concerning this problem:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"A1q\">\"Prejudice to the defendants, Nicols lack of good faith, or the unreasonableness of his conduct does not appear on the face of the complaint. Neither does any unreasonable delay in filing the case at bench, a factor which might also be at bar to the action in light of the equitable foundation of the applicable tolling rule. Nicols, supra, 83 Cal.App. 3d, at pp. 963 and 964.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b53-6\">The purpose of the statute of limitations is to prevent surprise to the defendant from the assertion of stale claims. In light of that purpose, the factor of unreasonable delay must be weighed. I conclude that there was not unreasonable delay in the filing of the case in this court. Melcher, et al v. The Continental Insurance Company, Superior Court of Guam, Civil Case No. 15-79, Order filed March 22, 1979.</p>\n    <p id=\"b53-7\">It is therefore ordered that the motion be, and it hereby is, denied.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Plaintiff appeared through counsel Paul J. Rodgers, and defendant was represented by counsel E. R. Crain. Court ruled to reserve decision.</p>\n    <p id=\"b41-11\">This court, upon review of all the records submitted herein, denies defendant's motion for the following reasons. Defendant bases her motion on the inconsistencies arising between the original summons mailed to her November 16, 1979 pursuant to the original complaint, and the summons she subsequently received December 31, 1979 mailed pursuant to plaintiff's amended complaint and order of the court for service by publication issued December 18, 1979. The Court bases its decision upon the sufficiency of the summons mailed in December pursuant to the order for publication. The court will not consider the sufficiency of the summons mailed November which was not directed by the court for publication.</p>\n    <p id=\"b41-12\">Section 413 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides the time frame within which a defendant must respond to the summons served by order of publication, \"... the service of the summons is complete at the expiration of the time prescribed by the order of publication.\" A defendant must respond prior to the expiration of the order. As indicated by the order of publication issued December 18, 1979, the court allowed a two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>(2) months time frame for publication, therefore allowing defendant two (2) months to respond. For reasons unclear to the court, the original summons was altered by the clerk of the court by striking our \"20\" and interlineating above it the number \"30\" while leaving unaltered the word \"twenty\" (\". . . twenty (2G) 30 days . . .\"), thus producing an obvious inconsistency and defect. Under Rule 61 of the Rules of Civil Procedure it is provided that \"The Court at every stage of the preceding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\" Material prejudice to substantial rights rights of the party against whom process is issued seldom results from errors and defects in the process, and the doctrine of harmless error has been applied to such errors and defects. Southern Oil Corp. v. Waggoner, 276 F 487; Massachusetts Bonding and Ins. Co. v. Concrete Steel Bridge Co., 37 F2d 695. Under Rule 61 the Court finds harmless error in the sufficiency of the summons as altered by the court clerk.</p>\n    <p id=\"b42-4\">Plaintiff contends that even if a defect were to exist in the summons, over 100 days have since elapsed and as yet defendant has not filed a response, thus inferring that any response now would be untimely. It would seem inequitable for this court to bind defendant to the two (2) month requirement for response when due in part to clerical error by the clerk the summons was served in a defective state. Therefore, defendant shall be allowed an additional period within which to file her answer in this case.</p>\n    <p id=\"b42-5\">IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that defendant's motion to quash is DENIED, and that defendant file an answer herein with 30 days of this order.</p>\n    <p id=\"b42-6\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

On November 26, 1979, a Motion to Suppress was scheduled in the Superior Court in People of the Territory of Guam v. Larry J. Flores, (S.Ct. No. 90F-79). However, rather than hear the motion to suppress, the Superior Court entertained an application to disqualify the Attorney General of Guam from acting as prosecutor in the case. On that same date an order was signed by the Honorable Paul J. Abbate, in which he disqualified the Attorney General's Office, due to an alleged conflict of interest, and in which the Presiding Judge then appointed a Special Prosecutor of his own choice.</p>\n    <p id=\"b136-5\">On December 5, 1979, a Stay Order was\u2019 entered by the District Court, ordering the Superior Court to refrain from taking any further action in People v. Flores, supra, pending the final determination of a December 5, 1979 Writ of Prohibition filed by the Government. An initial hearing was had on this matter on December 17, 1979, with proceedings continued until December 27, 1979 so that the parties could have additional time to brief the issues presented.</p>\n    <p id=\"b136-6\">This Memorandum Order results from the December 27, 1979 hearing on Writ of Prohibition, in which counsel for all interested parties appeared.</p>\n    <p id=\"b136-7\">This whole matter concerns several very important issues of separation of power as delineated in the Organic Act of Guam, 48 U.S.C. \u00a71421, et seq., and contained in the common law. Even though the Attorney General strenuously objected to the lack of notice and opportunity given to prepare, the Superior Court continued with the motion to disqualify when only a motion to suppress was scheduled to be heard. Also, only unsworn representations of counsel were considered, with no attempt to hear legally admitted evidence.</p>\n    <p id=\"b136-8\">On the face of the authority submitted by the Government, People v. Carlos G. Camacho, [1 Guam R. 501] it seems evident that the Organic Act of Guam, 48 U.S.C. \u00a71421, \u00a71422, et seq., forbids the appointment of a special prosecutor by any body of government other than the Executive Branch. If adequate notice was given to counsel for the Government, perhaps the Superior Court would have been supplied with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>above Guam Supreme Court case and it would have been aided in making its decision.</p>\n    <p id=\"b137-3\">The District Court sees no reason why it should make a de novo decision on matters which were not fully briefed and presented before the Superior Court of Guam. The November 26, 1979 Decision and Order of the Superior Court is vacated, and the Superior Court is ordered to schedule a hearing on the disqualification issue with full and adequate notice being given to counsel for both sides. With the vacating of the November 26, 1979 Decision and Order, the appointment of a \"Special Prosecutor\" by the Superior Court is declared a nullity.</p>\n    <p id=\"b137-4\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n    <p id=\"b137-5\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The search warrant also ordered the police to \"conduct a search of the above described location, curtilage, and persons present therein for the controlled substance heroin...\"</p>\n    <p id=\"b34-5\">The affidavit in support of the search warrant indicated that the informant had observed many persons on the premises using heroin and that the drug-related activity thereon was of a continuing nature.

VILLAGOMEZ, Minor</parties>\n  <docketnumber id=\"b46-3\">Civil Nos. 190-79 <em>&amp; </em>102-80</docketnumber>\n  <court id=\"AhA\">Superior Court of Guam</court>\n  <decisiondate id=\"AIJ\">May 7, 1980</decisiondate>\n  <opinion type=\"majority\">\n    <author id=\"b46-6\">WEEKS, Judge</author>\n    <p id=\"b46-7\">DECISION</p>\n    <p id=\"b46-8\">On July 8, 1979 and March 27, 1980, petitions were filed by the Attorney General of Guam asking for the certification of the minor Frankie E. Villagomez for prosecution as an adult pursuant to \u00a7255 et. seq., of the Guam Code of Civil Procedure. The petitions alleged in the earlier, the offense of Theft by Unlawful Taking of a Motor Vehicle, in the other Aggravated Escape and Unlawful Use of a Motor Vehicle.</p>\n    <p id=\"b46-9\">Section 255 of the Guam Code of Civil Procedure provides as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b46-10\">\"Certification to courts for criminal proceedings. If a child sixteen (16) years of age or older is charged with a public offense, and if the court after full investigation deems it contrary to the best interest of such child or of the public to retain jurisdiction, it may in its discretion certify such child for proper criminal proceedings to any court which would have trial jurisdiction of such offense if committed by an adult, but no child under sixteen (16) years of age shall be so certified; provided, that such certifying judge shall not in turn preside over the criminal proceedings against such child. (Enacted 1953; amended by P.L. 2-60, effective February 10, 1954.)\"</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b46-11\">Hearing was held on 30 April and 1 May, 1980, the minor being represented by Robert Bryant, Esquire, and the people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>being represented by Diane Pierson, Assistant Attorney General of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b47-3\">Testimony was heard from the owners of the vehicles in question and the officers concerned in the apprehension in each motor vehicle charge. The Division of Youth Affairs employee injured in the escape at issue was examined as well as three (3) minors who admitted participation.</p>\n    <p id=\"b47-4\">This all concerned the commission of the alleged offenses. All remaining witnesses on both sides testified regarding the minor himself and his response to treatment, proposed or past.</p>\n    <p id=\"b47-5\">In determining whether to grant or deny the petition, this Court will use the eight (8) \"determination factors\" provided in the appendix to the opinion of the Court in Kent v. United States, 383 U.S. 541, 86 S Ct. 1045, 162 Ed. 2d 84., as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b47-6\">\"1. The seriousness of the alleged offense to the community and whether the protection of the community requires waiver.\"</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b47-7\">While the theft of property such as an automobile is a real hardship and an expense to the victim, it cannot, even when one speaks of a series of them, convey an urgency to put a minor in the adult system. The escape is not so clear cut. Certainly the prospect of escaped felons at loose in a community is serious. With the escape from a juvenile Facility, more attention must be paid to the succeeding factor, i. e., the character of the escape.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b47-8\">\"2. Whether the alleged offense was committed in an aggressive, violent, premeditated or willful manner.\"</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b47-9\">The evidence is undisputable in the motor vehicle charges that neither the acquisition or the vehicles or the apprehension of the minor involved violence. The escape testimony was to the effect that there was violence against Division of Youth Affairs personnel but it is not clear who effected the violence since the other participating minors contradicted their earlier statements that the minor struck the guard. It was clear that he had brandished a possible weapon, i. e. an electric fan.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b47-10\">\"3. Whether the alleged offense was against persons . or against property, greater weight being given to offenses against persons especially if personal injury resulted.\"</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b47-11\">The offense of aggravated escape included an offense against a person. The theft and unlawful' use were against property.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b48-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\"4. The prosecutive merit of the complaint, i. e., whether there is evidence upon which a Grand Jury may be expected to return an indictment (to be determined by consultation with the United States Attorney).\"</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b48-3\">The testimony presented at the hearing by the witnesses concerning commission of the alleged offenses would unquestionably justify the return of a true bill against the minor by a grand jury with respect to all indictable offenses.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b48-4\">\"5. The desirability of trial and disposition of the entire offense in one court when the juvenile's associates in the alleged offense are adults who will be charged with a crime in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\" (Not applicable)</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b48-5\">\"6. The sophistication and maturity of the juvenile as determined by consideration of his home, environmental situation, emotional attitude and pattern of living.\"</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b48-6\">The minor was born on 26 December 1962. In a broad sense, anyone who commits antisocial acts, such as charged against the minor, must be classified as immature regardless of chronological age. However, it is not believed that the term \"maturity\" as used in the standard was used in that sense because then obviously no minor could ever be certified. The forensic psychiatrist who testified for the Government in this matter indicated in her written report and on the stand that the minor is immature \"even for his years\" which seems to indicate excessive immaturity. Furthermore, the term \" sophistication\" is used with the term \"maturity\". Sophistication is defined in Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, Merriam-Webster, page 1101, copyright 1979, as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b48-7\">\"sophistication * * * 3: the process or result of becoming cultured knowledgeable, or disillusioned; esp: CULTIVATION, URBANITY 4: the process or result of becoming more complex, developed, or subtle\"</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b48-9\">None of the offenses alleged show a particular degree of sophistication \u2014 the escape showed no guile and was simplistic in operation. The personality traits described by the probation officer and all those who have been with him over the years show a spoiled manipulative child rather than a calculating adult.</p>\n    <p id=\"b48-10\">The home life of the minor has in fact been, except for brief interludes with his brother, in an institution or foster homes. In most instances the minor left them with or without the consent of the juvenile authorities before any one could achieve a lasting effect.</p>\n    <p id=\"b49-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The minor's drunken state on the occasions of his apprehensions which was described by several of the witnesses indicates a condition which the psychiatrist described as \"Alcoholism\" begun young. This is a condition which one associates with older persons but cannot as such be deemed a mark of either sophistication or maturity.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b49-6\">\"7. The record and previous history of the juvenile, including previous contacts with the Youth Aid Division, other law enforcement agencies, juvenile courts and other jurisdiction, prior periods of probation to this Court, or prior commitments to juvenile institutions.\"</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b49-7\">Jess Guerrero testified as a Probation Officer. His contact with the minor went back over the seven years of Mr. Guerrero's experience as a Probation Officer and it was he who recommended to the Government that certification be sought. He outlined for the Court the four foster home breakdowns, the failure of placement in Sanctuary and Cottage Home Facility. He also commented on the progression of severity of the offenses - from statutory offenses to felony escape. However, the Court notes this is not a steady escalation but rather a succession (lengthy) of nonviolent crimes against property culminating in the escape which involved injury to a Division of Youth Affairs staff member.</p>\n    <p id=\"b49-9\">The frustration of the probation officer is apparent. His best efforts on behalf of the minor have not changed the minor's attitude. Frank still 'walks' when the desire hits him to leave his current situation.</p>\n    <p id=\"b49-10\">John Balajadia, Division of Youth Affairs Superintendent, testified as to the minor's twenty-five (25) contacts with the system. His opinion was that Juvenile Justice could not offer long term treatment. It is noted that there is not a long time left for the juvenile stage of this young man's life. It was not stated that the drinking problem was treated while the minor was at the facility.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b49-11\">\"8. The prospects for adequate protection of the public and the likelihood of reasonable rehabilitation of the juvenile (if he is found to have committed the alleged offense) by the use of procedures, services and facilities currently available to the Juvenile Court.\"</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b49-12\">The Sad Man's World experience outlined to the Court by Mr. Hoffman is a deterrent directed \"tour\" of the Guam Adult Correctional Facility coupled with a conference of the minor so conducted, by a selected group of inmates including convicted murderers. It is a \"sense\" oriented experience to give the minor a realistic view of life within prison walls completely authentic, completely deglamorized.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>ISA - the live-in facility directed by Mr. Perez, offers a support environment for adults and minors who have a drug problem. (See Paragraph 6 with respect to minor's problem). Although the minor left the premises while under Court order to stay there, the Director and inmates have indicated their willingness to receive him again. It is noted that upon his absenting himself from ISA, the minor went to the authorities and turned himself in and did not attempt to hide from the authorities.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-3\">Neither of these procedures has been really utilized for this minor (the ISA experience was too short lived to be evaluated). Their potential effectiveness is apparent to the Court and well suited to this minor's situation. A new attitude is already manifested in his return to the Lockup upon leaving ISA.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-4\">Upon analysis of the eight (8) determining factors discussed above, it is the opinion of the Court that it is in the best interest of the minor and of the public for the Juvenile Court to retain jurisdiction.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-5\">Judgment shall be in accordance herewith.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

All parties appeared by counsel, and the individual defendants in person.</p>\n    <p id=\"b43-15\">The action is on two promissory notes and on the chattel mortgage securing payment of one of the notes. No issue is presented as to the balance owed, consideration, or genuineness of the makers' and endorsers' signatures. There were two issues to be resolved at the trial:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b43-16\">(1) After the plaintiff repossessed the security, was it sold for a reasonable price?</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b43-17\">(2) George Tamura was an executive of the plaintiff and at the same time, according to the. defendants, served as a director and as secretary-treasurer of the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>corporation. The defendants allege a breach of the fiduciary obligation of Mr. Tamura to the defendant corporation which justifies relieving the individual defendants from any obligation under the notes. Pre-trial Order, p. 2.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b44-4\">Extensive evidence concerning the condition of the security and the circumstances of the sales was presented. I find that the proceeds received from the sale of the security constituted reasonable value.</p>\n    <p id=\"b44-5\">In closing argument the attorney for the individual defendants stated tha second issue in words such as these: that George Tamura was an experienced banker, and alone of the three investors (Tamura and the individual defendants) had the ability to manage the financial aspects of the corporation; that great trust was placed in him by the others; and the the fiduciary relation thus created required that he make full disclosure to them of the nature of their obligation on the notes, specifically that they were liable as individuals thereon. The defendants' counsel then stated that it was not shown that such disclosure had been made.</p>\n    <p id=\"b44-6\">In this case there is no evidence at all that Mr. Tamura made any misrepresentation to the defendants, coerced them to sign, concealed any matter or profited from the transactions. When the defendant corporation became insolvent I infer that his $7,000 investment was lost. It was well known to the individual defendants that Mr. Tamura was the chief executive officer of the plaintiff \u2014 its general manager.</p>\n    <p id=\"b44-7\">The first note that is the subject of this suit is dated May 7, 1974 and is in the principal amount of $60,500. It is secured by a chattel mortgage. This note is Exhibit \"1\" in evidence, and Exhibit \"C\" of the complaint. It refinances three delinquent notes. Exhibits \"H\" and \"I\" are two of the notes. Francisco T. Torre is the maker of the notes. Exhibit \"32\" shows that Francisco T. Torre and Fred A. Torres were the makers of the third note. Exhibit \"2\" shows that many interest payments were made on this note for $60,500.</p>\n    <p id=\"b44-8\">The second note involved in this action is also dated May 7, 1974, and is in the principal amount of $40,000. This note is Exhibit \"3\" in evidence, and Exhibit \"A\" of the complaint. It refinances four delinquent notes and secures an additional loan of $23,500 which was disbursed by check to the defendant corporation. Exhibits \"12\" and \"13\" show that Francisco T. Torre was the maker of two of the notes and received a check for the loan proceeds. Exhibit \"11\" shows that Francisco T. Torre and Fred A. Torres were the makers. Exhibit \"4\" shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>that many interest payments were made on this note for $40,000.</p>\n    <p id=\"b45-3\">The proceeds of these individual loans were apparently deposited to the corporation account. No issue of the application of the funds is before the court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b45-4\">The second issue, whether as stated in the pretrial order or in the closing argument of the defendants, must be resolved against the defendants and in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n    <p id=\"b45-5\">I do not believe that the defendants thought that the earlier notes (which were refinanced) were signed by them other than as individuals. Two are in evidence and show that the borrower signed under the words \"I do not desire disability and/or credit life insurance,\" as well as \"mortgagee\" at the bottom of the form. I infer the other notes were similar.</p>\n    <p id=\"b45-6\">As to the fact question of whether Mr. Tamura made \"full disclosure\" to the individual defendants of their liability under Exhibits \"1\" and \"3\", I do not find, that because of conflicting testimony, that Mr. Tamura explicitly told them as endorsers they would be individually liable for the payments of the notes in the event that the corporation defaulted. They were told that because of the delinquency of the other notes, that refinancing was necessary. The notes themselves are unequivocal that the signatures of the individual defendants are made in two capacities, first signing as officers of the corporation and as the act of the corporation, and next signing as individuals. The signatures as individuals appear just under the paragraph consisting of this one sentence, \"Each of the undersigned hereby indorses and guarantees payment and performance of this Note and Chattel Mortgage and agrees to and accepts all of terms, covenants, conditions and provisions thereof,\" and on a line under which the words \"Indorser/Guarantor\" appear.</p>\n    <p id=\"b45-7\">I conclude that Mr. Tamura did not breach his fiduciary duty as asserted in closing argument of defendants' counsel. Contrary to the circumstances that defendants assert, I find that Mr. Tamura did not entirely carry out the financial aspects of the corporation, but that substantial accounting, bookkeeping and financial matters were carried out at the office of Francisco T. Torre.</p>\n    <p id=\"b45-8\">The individual defendants cannot avoid liability on the ground that Mr. Tamura failed to explicitly inform them of their individual liability.</p>\n    <p id=\"b45-9\">The plaintiff is requested to submit a proposed judgment approved as to form or seen by defendants.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

He relies on \u00a7164 of the Civil Code as authority as does defendant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b69-12\">Defendant alleges that the property is her separate property, title being in her name alone, and further alleges its purchase was with funds within her separate control.</p>\n    <p id=\"b69-13\">The parties by stipulation segregated this issue from the divorce trial at which the decree was granted to the husband.</p>\n    <p id=\"b69-14\">Although the general rule is that property acquired by either spouse during marriage is presumed to be community property an exception is made in Civil Code \u00a7164, which states that if property \"is acquired by a married woman by an instrument in writing, the presumption is that the same is her separate property\".</p>\n    <p id=\"b69-15\">Certain circumstances may raise a presumption of gift, particularly a presumption of a gift from the husband to the wife. If the wife acquires property by an instrument in writing in her name alone, for example, merely .showing that the husband paid for the property with community funds is not sufficient to rebut the presumption of Civil Code \u00a7164 that it is her separate property. A presumption that the husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>intended by his acts to make a gift to the wife then arises. Pabst v. Shearer (1916) 172 C. 239, 156 P. 466; Alferitz v. Arrivillage (1904) 143 C. 646, 77 P. 657; Estate of Freemen (1953) 115 C.A. 2d 827, 252 P.2d 996.</p>\n    <p id=\"b70-3\">The same presumption of gift arises where the husband uses community funds or his separate funds to pay off an encumbrance on, or part of the purchase price of, his wife\u2019s separate property (Estate of Bernatas (1958) 162 C.A. 2d 693 328 P.2d 539; Estate Inman (1957) 148 C.A. 2d 952, 307 P.2d 953).</p>\n    <p id=\"b70-4\">However the presumption of gift by the husband to the wife is rebuttable and may be rebutted solely by the testimony of the husband, if believed, that he did not intend make a gift to the wife. Fanning v. Green (1909) 156 279, 104 P. 308; Estate of Cesare (1955) 130 C.A. 2d 557, 279 P.2d 607. Also the presumption is rebutted if it is shown that the wife used community funds to purchase property in her own name without her husband's knowledge. Louknitsky v. Louknitsky (1954) 123 C.A. 2d 406, 266 P.2d 910.</p>\n    <p id=\"b70-5\">It is settled that property purchased with separate funds continues to be separate property. Smith v. Smith, 12 C. 216; Flournoy v. Flournoy, 86 C. 286, 24 P. 1012; Svetinich v. Sheean, 124 C. 216, 56 P. 1028; Williams v. Tam, 131 C. 64, 63 P. Tomaier v. Tomaier, 23 C 2d 754, 146 P.2d 905; Huber v. Huber, 27 C 2d 784, 167 P.2d 708. That is, separate property does not lose its character as such merely because there is a change in the form or identity of the property. 10 Cal. Jur. 2d 680, \u00a718.</p>\n    <p id=\"b70-6\">Separate property may be transmuted into community property if it is commingled with community property in such a manner that it is impossible to segregate. However, if it is possible to trace the separate property, it retains its character as separate property even though it may have undergone a change in form or identity. Patterson v. Patterson, 242 C.A. 2d 333, 341; Mears v. Mears, 180 C.A. 2d 484, 499-500; Kenney v. Kenney, 128 C.A. 2d 128, 135; Thomasset v. Thomasset, 122 C.A. 2d 116, 124.</p>\n    <p id=\"b70-7\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the facts of the instant case.</p>\n    <p id=\"b70-8\">Undisputed facts are that during the marriage $150.00 to $200.00 a month was sent to Mrs. Scofield's mother for her maintenance. In 1978, Mrs. Scofield had a saving account in her name as trustee for her mother in which there was a balance of $20,000.00. Mr. Scofield also had a checking account which he monitored very carefully as shown by the records he testified to keeping and the running balance accounts put into evidence. There was also a savings account for their son with Mrs. Scofield as trustee.</p>\n    <p id=\"b71-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The property in issue which is adjacent to the leased home they then occupied became available. The availability was made known first to Mr. Scofield who indicated he would tell his wife. They went together to Realtor Pangelinan's office and Mrs. Scofield left to get the $10,000.00 required. She returned with cash in that amount. The papers were prepared at that time in the presence of both and in her name.</p>\n    <p id=\"b71-3\">It is further undisputed that the house in question was never occupied by the parties but was occupied by a close friend of Mrs. Scofield who made necessary repairs to the building in lieu of rent.</p>\n    <p id=\"b71-4\">The Court finds the controlling presumption is the exception to \u00a7164 which passes to plaintiff the burden of showing that the property in the name of the wife is not her separate property.</p>\n    <p id=\"b71-5\">Plaintiff seeks to do this by asserting that the intent behind the use of her name as owner was to avoid lengthy probate in the event of his death, which at the time he felt was imminent. He presented witnesses who testified that Mrs. Scofield always referred to the property as \"ours\" not \"mine\", to show her awareness of his intent.</p>\n    <p id=\"b71-7\">The mere fact that she referred to the residence as \"ours\" does not constitute substantial evidence of such as intent by either. In re:Marriaqe of Jofeman 29 C.A. 244, 258, 105 Cal. Rptr. 483.</p>\n    <p id=\"b71-8\">Plaintiff further testified that for the same reason title to a certain vehicle was also placed solely in her, although it purchase was clearly with community funds, but such is presumed to be a gift under the law cited earlier.</p>\n    <p id=\"b71-9\">He also seeks to persuade the Court that the purchase was made with the community funds sent to this mother-in-law over the years of his marriage. The defendant testified that the account used for the $10,000.00 cash payment was that in the name of her mother and herself. The testimony of Mrs. Scofield was that the account represented the proceeds of the sale of the mother\u2019s family home of many years in Korea.</p>\n    <p id=\"b71-10\">Since the sums sent were for the continuing maintenance of the mother-in-law over the years and there was nothing to show that there was joint-use and accumulation of $10,000.00, the Court finds it more likely that the money was as defendant testified.</p>\n    <p id=\"b71-11\">The $5,000.00 from the son's account which went into and out of Mrs. Scofield and her mother's account is seen by this Court as sufficiently identified and traced by amount and dates in and out to preclude denomination of the total funds as commingled.</p>\n    <p id=\"b71-12\">The Court further finds that the degree of care exercised by Mr. Scofield in keeping his financial records make less than creditable his account of his behavior at the house sale. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>indicates a complete lack of awareness as to the actual source of the money that is not in accord with the evidence that his own accounts were kept meticulously. The Court can only assume that his indifference was because it wasn't his money involved.</p>\n    <p id=\"b72-3\">The checks in evidence from his account as proof of incidental payments at the time closing or for taxes are deemed gifts to the wife for the expenses for her separate property and do not change the character of it.</p>\n    <p id=\"b72-4\">From a consideration of the undisputed facts and a weighing of the documentary evidence and testimony of. the two parties and witnesses, this Court finds that there has not been a commingling of community funds, that the purchase was made with separate funds of the wife, that such purchase was made in the name of the wife with the husband's full knowledge and that the plaintiff has failed to overcome the presumption of defendant's separate ownership.</p>\n    <p id=\"b72-5\">Because this Court finds that the property in question is defendant's separate property it is not necessary of it to rule on the authenticity of the alleged property settlement agreement.</p>\n    <p id=\"b72-6\">The attorney for the defendant is requested to submit and order approved as to form by plaintiff's counsel.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Salas was charged with the crimes of receiving stolen property, conspiracy to receive stolen property and perjury. At trial, several statements made by Salas were introduced into evidence over objection. At the close of the People's case, Salas' motion for judgment of acquittal was granted as to the charge of conspiracy to receive stolen property, but the jury returned a verdict of guilty as to the charge of receiving stolen property.</p>\n    <p id=\"b153-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>During April of 1976, the Department of Public Safety began investigating alleged illegal activities by certain police officers. Lieutenant Joaquin Torre was assigned as the chief investigator for the investigation into police corruption. Sometime thereafter, Torre learned through Lieutenant D.V. Camacho, that Salas \"had some information on the investigation.\"</p>\n    <p id=\"b153-4\">The evidence shows that Salas had told a fellow officer, A.B. Pangelinan, about information which he had concerning possible police corruption. Defendant and Pangelinan thereafter tried to find someone in the police department whom they could trust to share this information with. Pangelinan approached Lieutenant Francisco Sab\u00edan and Lieutenant Camacho, and eventually Salas did share his information with them. Having voluntarily shared this information with police officers Pangelinan, Sab\u00edan and Camacho, it is reasonable to conclude that Salas had no reason to believe that the matter would be dropped.</p>\n    <p id=\"b153-6\">On May 8, 1976, Torre instructed Lieutenant Camacho to ask Salas to come down to the station and answer questions, but Salas did not show up. Whereupon Torre asked Lieutenant Camacho to, \"Get him.\" A patrolman was sent to contact the defendant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b153-7\">Defendant thereafter appeared and was directed to the Director's conference room where questioning was conducted by Torre. Lieutenants Sab\u00edan and Camacho were also in the room, although Sab\u00edan did move in and out of the room during the interrogation.</p>\n    <p id=\"b153-8\">The questioning lasted for approximately one hour and was tape recorded. A transcript of the recording was made and two days later defendant was called back to read and sign the statement.</p>\n    <p id=\"b153-9\">On April 22 and 27, 1977, defendant was summoned to testify before the Grand Jury, during which time he was questioned almost exclusively concerning his May 8, 1976 statement.</p>\n    <p id=\"b153-11\">Defendant was also subpoenaed by the Legislature's Select Committee on Police Corruption commanding him to testify before the committee at 10:00 a.m. on April 25, 1977. Along with the subpoena, he was given a copy of the \"Standing Rules of the Legislative Committee on Police Corruption.\" Defendant was never, however formally placed under oath and questioned by the Committee. He did, however, talk with a member of the Committee and staff investigators of the Committee. The subject of the questions related to matters previously revealed at the May 8, 1976 police interrogation.</p>\n    <p id=\"b153-12\">Appellant argues for reversal of his conviction on several grounds. Initially he alleges error in denying the Motion to Suppress the statement made at the May 8, 1976 meeting, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>claims that his further statements to the Grand Jury and the Select Committee should have been suppressed as fruit of a poisonous tree. Furthermore, appellant argues that statements given to the Grand Jury and members of the Select Committee should have been suppressed for failure to comply with the Miranda warnings.</p>\n    <p id=\"b154-3\">The momentous decision of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966) set \u25a0 forth rules of police procedure applicable to custodial interrogations. The United States Supreme Court there explained that custodial interrogation means, \"questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\" 384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612. It is to be noted however, that any interview will have coercive elements to it, simply by virtue of the fact that the police officer is part of a law enforcement system that may ultimately cause the interviewee to be charged with a crime. But police officers are not required to administer Miranda warnings to everyone whom they question. Nor is the requirement of warnings to be imposed simply because the questioning takes place in the police station, or because the questioned person is one whom the police suspect. Miranda warnings are required only where there has been such a restriction on a person's freedom as to render him \"in custody.\"</p>\n    <p id=\"b154-4\">Special safeguards ar.e required in the \u2022 case of incommunicado interrogation of individuals in a police-dominated atmosphere, resulting in self-incriminating statements without full warnings of constitutional rights. Beckwith v. United States, 425 U.S. 345, 96 S.Ct. 1612 (1976). It is this sort of environment to which Miranda by terms was made applicable, and to which it is limited. Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U.S. 495, 97 S.Ct. 711 (1977).</p>\n    <p id=\"b154-6\">The situation in People v. Williams, 56 Misc. 2d 837, 290 N.Y.S. 2d 321 (N.Y. 1968) reported in 31 A.L.R. 3d 565, 652 aids in the resolution of this case. There, three hours of questioning of an experienced precinct police officer in the station house squad room by \"high ranking police officials\" in an effort to determine whether his automobile, the license plate number of which had been identified at the scene of a holdup, had been in his possession, stolen or used without his knowledge, was held not to be a custodial interrogation requiring Miranda warnings. In concluding that the inquiry had never reached the accusatorial stage, the court observed that the interrogation had been confined to the subject of the whereabouts, possession and control of the defendant's automobile at the time in question; that reference by the investigators to the fact that the crime of robbery had been committed had served only to emphasize the need for, rather than the focal point of, the inquiry; and that there had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>no effort to extract a confession from the defendant. The court further noted that the defendant, an experienced police officer, trained to investigate and interrogate and as much at home in the station house environment as the private citizen would be ordinarily at work made him less susceptible to \"the type of brow beating inquisitions unfortunate examples of which, in large measure prompted the Miranda safeguards.\" The station house squad room is always frequented by police officers, was in a manner of speaking, the natural habitat of the defendant, the court said, and the fears, terrors and tensions which undoubtedly possess the mind of the lay suspect when called upon to submit to interrogation in the police station, are entirely foreign to a precinct police officer.</p>\n    <p id=\"b155-3\">In the present case, there is ample indication that the questioning took place in a context where defendant's freedom to depart was not restricted. The defendant was not placed under arrest, and was a police officer, apparently well versed in Miranda rights, and supposedly arrest procedures. He was not handcuffed or otherwise detained and the interview took place in the police department conference room. It is uncontradicted that the defendant came into the conference room to provide information on police corruption in general.</p>\n    <p id=\"b155-4\">He had voluntarily provided this information earlier to other members of the police department, two of whom were present at the \"interrogation,\" which thereby dispels defendant's contention that the questioning was conducted in a coercive custodial atmosphere. The occasion was but another attempt on the part of the defendant to repeat his information to the officer who was in charge of the investigation.</p>\n    <p id=\"b155-5\">After the interview, the defendant left, presumably to continue his police duties. Furthermore, the testimony of Lieutenant Torre as well as the other officers, indicates that the defendant was not the focus of the investigation. It was only after the interview that Torre perceived that the property the defendant received was stolen.</p>\n    <p id=\"b155-6\">We cannot find that the defendant was the focus or subject of any alleged criminal activity at the time of the interview, nor can we hold that his freedom of action was curtailed in any way. Accordingly, we hold that the May 8th interview was not a custodial interrogation. It is clear from the circumstances of this case that there was no significant deprivation of freedom of action warranting the application of the warnings required by Miranda v. Arizona.</p>\n    <p id=\"b155-7\">Appellant in his opening brief argued that the statements made by defendant at the Territorial Grand Jury should have been suppressed. However, in his reply brief, he withdrew from the court's consideration of this issue, since he relied strongly on United States v. Mandujano, 416 F.2d 1050 (5th Cir. 1974). Mandujano was reversed by the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Supreme Court, 425 U.S. 564, 96 S.Ct. 1768, 48 L. Ed. 2d 212 (1976). Apparently, Mandujano stands for the proposition that Miranda warnings are not required to be given to a grand jury witness, even if that witness were a virtual or putative defendant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b156-3\">Appellant further argues that statements he made to the chief investigator, counsel and member of the Select Committee on April 26, 1977 should have been suppressed for failure to comply with Miranda. However, it appears that neither the attorney, the senator, nor the investigator was a policeman or police agent. Miranda warnings are not required unless there is custodial police interrogation. Miranda v. Arizona, supra, 384 U.S. 436, 444.</p>\n    <p id=\"b156-4\">Appellant raises two further arguments. First he argues that the Government should have been estopped from prosecuting him, and second, argues that all the statements to the Grand Jury and the Select Committee should have been suppressed as fruit of a poisonous tree. We find no basis for the estoppel argument, and since there has been no untoward conduct on the part of the Government, appellant's . final argument likewise fails.</p>\n    <p id=\"b156-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the verdict of the court below.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Aguon (hereinafter \"Aguon\").</p>\n    <p id=\"b207-6\">Aguon owned a parcel of property, Lot 165-1. Municipality of Yona, which is officially designated Ylig Bay. On May 1, 1972 Aguon, as landlord, and Integrated Development Agency, Inc., (hereinafter \"IDA\"), as tenants, entered into a lease agreement whereby IDA leased the subject lot for a term of fifty-five (55) years.</p>\n    <p id=\"b207-7\">The lease has a provision providing that the tenant shall have quiet use and enjoyment of the premises during the lease term.</p>\n    <p id=\"b207-8\">IDA took possession of the property and proceeded to explore the possibility of its commercial development as a tourist facility. IDA expended about $200,000 toward this end by September 1972. On about September 15, 1972, IDA sublet a portion of Lot 165-1 to plaintiff-appellant Turtle Cove. Aguon gave express written consent to the sublease as required by the lease with IDA.</p>\n    <p id=\"b207-9\">Thereafter, Turtle Cove entered upon the property and expended large sums of money to develop portions of the property.</p>\n    <p id=\"b207-10\">On or about September 19, 1972, a quiet title action affecting Lot 165-1 was filed by Francisco and Josefina Roberto as Civil Case No. 154-72, District Court of Guam, naming Aguon as defendant. A Notice of Lis Pendens was filed in conjunction with the lawsuit which had an immediate impact on Turtle Cove's development financing. The ensuing litigation lasted thirty-three months including an appeal to the Ninth Circuit. The final judgment was in favor of Aguon establishing that Aguon held title as against the Robertos.</p>\n    <p id=\"b207-11\">On July 27, 1978, Turtle Cove filed its amended complaint naming the Aguon estate (the Aguons passed away during the intervening years) and IDA as defendants. A breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is alleged in paragraph XII of the First Cause of Action which contains the following language:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b207-12\">\"Aguon breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment as to plaintiff Turtle Cove in that at the time express approval was given to the sublease between IDA and Turtle Cove. Aguon had in fact not perfected title to the property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>thereby creating circumstances wherein an action to quiet title was brought against Aguon in Civil Action No. 154-72, District Court of Guam. . .\"</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b208-5\">On August 30, 1978, a motion for summary judgment was filed by Aguon. The trial court found in favor of Aguon. Turtle Cove filed a Notice of Appeal for review of the question of Aguon's alleged breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment as set forth in the First Cause of Action.</p>\n    <p id=\"b208-6\">Turtle Cove has not supported its claim on the averment of paragraph XII of the First Cause of Action to the effect that Aguon had not perfected title to the property. The final outcome of the quiet title action settled this issue. Turtle Cove contends that there was, a long standing dispute with respect to the ownership of Lot 165-1, Yona, between the Aguons and the Robertos, which dispute had been disclosed to Turtle Cove or IDA. There is no averment in the complaint to support this concept.</p>\n    <p id=\"b208-7\">Aguon's covenant of quiet enjoyment imposed an obligation to defend against the claims of third parties claiming paramount title. Aguon did so, first in the trial court and then on appeal. Aguon could not prevent litigation of unsupportable claims which might be made by strangers to the title.</p>\n    <p id=\"b208-8\">The situation which has caused economic loss to the lessee as a result of delays incident to litigation is not analogous to the cases cited by plaintiff's counsel. All of such cases have had an element of fault on the part of the landowner which resulted in interference with quiet enjoyment of the demised premises whether the fault was before or after the execution of a lease. The commencement of litigation by a third party claiming title was not shown to be the fault of Aguon.</p>\n    <p id=\"b208-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Petitioner's office was created by act of the Legislature, Public Law 13-51, approved by the Acting Governor on July 10, 1975. Funding for Petitioner's office was appropriated in P.L. 13-149 PART ONE Section l(o)E in the amount of $344,563.00.</p>\n    <p id=\"b83-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Pursuant to Executive Order, twenty per cent (20%) of Petitioner's funds were held in reserve and were not released to Petitioner. See Bureau of Budget and Management Research Circular No. 77-1.</p>\n    <p id=\"b83-3\">The issue raised by Petitioner's Complaint is whether Respondent Governor Bordallo's order that funds be held in reserve is an authorized act as applied to Petitioner Public Defender Service Corporation. The principal question that must be answered in determining the Governor's authority in this case is whether Petitioner's office is a part of the Executive Branch or part of the Judicial Branch of the Government of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b83-4\">This Court finds that Petitioner Public Defender Service Corporation is a part of the Judiciary Branch. The finding is based on the following considerations:</p>\n    <p id=\"b83-5\">1. The affidavits of eleven (11) senators of the Thirteenth Guam Legislature that they intended that the Public Defender Service Corporation be a part of the Judiciary Branch are persuasive authority that this was indeed the legislative intent of P.L. 13-51.</p>\n    <p id=\"b83-6\">2. In P.L. 13-149, Petitioner's budget appropriation was included in the subsection which allocated funds to the Supreme Court and the other portions of the Judicial Branch. P.L. 13-149 PART ONE, Section l(o).</p>\n    <p id=\"b83-7\">3. Under P.L. 13-51 \u00a760012(a), Petitioner's funds are administered through the General Administrative Services of the Judicial Branch.</p>\n    <p id=\"b83-8\">4. Petitioner's function is to represent persons who are deemed by the Courts to be financially unable to hire private counsel. Appointment of counsel for indigents is an inherent power of the Judiciary. Petitioner's office is a very necessary part of the sound administration of the Courts, and as such its function is essential to the Judiciary branch. See People v. Mullins 532 P 2d 736 , 739 (Colo. S. Ct., 1975).</p>\n    <p id=\"b83-9\">5. Although P.L. 13-51 provides that Title V of the Government Code of Guam will serve as the guideline for Petitioner's Director in personnel matters, Petitioner's employees have never been classified or processed as civil service employees and are treated by the personnel office as being under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Council.</p>\n    <p id=\"b83-10\">Having found that Petitioner is a part of the Judicial Branch of the Government of Guam, the Court holds that it is a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers required by the Organic Act for the Governor or any other member of the Executive Branch to interfere with Petitioner's receipt of legally appropriated funds.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

U.S. v. Karnes, 437 F.2d 284, 287 (9th Cir. 1971); cert. denied, 402 U.S. 1008, 91 S.Ct. 2189 (U.S. 1971).</p>\n    <p id=\"b109-10\">The Court finds \u00a717402 of the Government Code of Guam to be an unconstitutional infringement upon a citizen's First Amendment right to freedom of speech.</p>\n    <p id=\"b109-11\">The Court is not deciding whether or not the Government may constitutionally require commercial signs to be translated into English or Chamorro. That question is not before the Court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b109-12\">The Government asserts that Defendant \"has not carried the burden of affirmatively showing that as applied to him, the statute in unreasonable, unfair and oppressive.\" (emphasis ours.) No such burden exists in cases involving First Amendment rights. \"Although a statute may be neither vague, overbroad, nor otherwise invalid as applied to the conduct charged against a particular defendant, he is permitted to raise its vagueness or unconstitutional overbreadth as applied to others.\" Coates v. City of Cincinnati, 402 U.S. 611, 619, 91 S.Ct. 1686 (U.S. 1971). The Court of notes that this statute applies to commercial as well as noncommercial speech.</p>\n    <p id=\"b109-13\">At issue is the regulation of speech. The significance of this fact is that the extent of permissible regulation greatly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>increases as the mode of expression moves from pure speech to speech combined with conduct. California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109, 117, 93 S.Ct. 390 (U.S. 1973). \"Communication by signs and posters is virtually pure speech.\" Baldwin v. Redwood City, 540 F.2d 1360, 1366 (9th Cir. 1976); Karp v. Bechen, 477 F.2d 171, 176 (9th Cir. 1973); Ross Goshi, 351 F.Supp. 949 953 (D.C. Hawaii); Dulaney v. Municipal Court, 520 P.2d 1, 5-6 (Calif. 1974).</p>\n    <p id=\"b110-3\">\"(I)n the First Amendment area 'government may regulate. . . only with narrow specificity.\" Hynes v. Mayor and Council of Borough of Oradell, 425 U.S. 610, 620,96 S.Ct. 1755 (U.S. 1976), quoting N.A.A.C.P. v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433, 83 S.Ct. 328 (U.S. 1963). The Government of Guam must use the least restrictive means that would accomplish the legislative purpose of Bill 754 (15th Guam Legislature, 1979 First Regular Session). \"For even when pursuing a legitimate interest, a State may not choose means that unnecessarily restrict constitutionally protected liberty.... If the State has open to it a less drastic way of satisfying its legitimate interests, it may not choose a legislative scheme that broadly stifles the exercise of fundamental personal liberties.\" Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 58-59, 94 S.Ct. 303 (U.S. 1973).</p>\n    <p id=\"b110-5\">The Government asserts that \"... there is certainly a reasonable relation between the requirement of a translation on advertising signs and the heretofore referenced public interests which the statute was enacted to protect.\" The public interests being an \"...increased awareness of the content or message contained in signs used by island businesses for advertising purposes by the English and Chamorro speaking population for the purpose of greater patronizing of such places of business, and the strengthening of the island economy by capturing the attention of English speaking tourists and the predominantly English and Chamorro consumer on Guam.\"</p>\n    <p id=\"b110-6\">The Government further asserts that \"these are not necessarily the exclusive public interests which the statute was enacted to protect...\", but rather, \"... it is possible that the Legislature formulated additional reasons for enacting the statute,\" (emphasis ours.)</p>\n    <p id=\"b110-7\">Continuing, the Government asserts:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b110-8\">\"It is generally believed that one of the reasons the statute was enacted was to regulate the many businesses on Guam which have signs entirely in a language other than English or Chamorro that were reported to be advertising pornographic materials for sale. Thus, protection of the morals of the public might have been an additional reason for enacting the statute. Additional moral justification may have been due to the complaints by numerous Japanese tourist that some of these signs contained offensive or shocking language.\"</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b111-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>However, \"the question in this case is not whether some support for the regulations may be adduced, by reference to evidence in the record and a claim of reasonable inferences or concerns, but is whether the regulations at issue here are 'unnecessarily restrictive for the purpose they were designed to serve.'\" A Quaker Action Group v. Morton, 170 U.S. App. D.C. 124, 516 F.2d 717, 723-724 (1975), quoting A Quaker Action Group v. Morton, 148 U.S. App. D.C. 124, 516 F.2d 717, 723-724 (1975), quoting A Quaker Action Group v. Morton, 148 U.S. App. D.C. 346, 460 F.2d 854 860 (1971). \"For application of these principles to sign ordinances, see Farrell v. Township of Teaneck, 126 N.J. Super. 460, 315 A.2d 424 (N.J. 1974); Peltz v. City of South Euclid, 11 Ohio St. 2d 128, 228 N.E.2d 320 (Ohio 1967).\" 540 F.2d at 1367 n. 18.</p>\n    <p id=\"b111-3\">It is unnecessarily restrictive and beyond a \"reasonable\" relationship to include all \"permitted signs\" in an effort to specifically regulate \"advertising signs\". Careful consideration has been given as to whether \u00a717402 is more inclusive or more burdensome than necessary to further legitimate government purposes. Truly this section does not regulate with narrow specificity. Rather it has the potential to intrude upon the very first of the Amendments of the Constitution.</p>\n    <p id=\"b111-4\">Though the Government has so far restricted itself to \"the shopowners and business affected by the legislation\", this is of little comfort. \"So long as the statute remains available to the State the threat of prosecutions of protected expression is a real and substantial one. Even the prospect of ultimate failure of such prosecutions by no means dispels their chilling effect on protected expression.\" Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479 , 494 , 85 S.Ct. 1116 (U.S. 1965).</p>\n    <p id=\"b111-5\">The Court believes that a law requiring any permitted sign, no matter how big or small, on any land, be it public or private, in any language other than Chamorro or English to have a translation into either which \"must predominate the sign\", [has] a chilling effect on such a protected mode of expression.</p>\n    <p id=\"b111-6\">Furthermore, this Court cannot change the law under the guise of construction so as to only apply to business entities. \"The rewriting of a statute for the purpose of bringing about a particular result is certainly not within the judicial function.\" U.S. v. Angcog, 190 F.Supp. 696, 700 (D.C. 1961).</p>\n    <p id=\"b111-7\">As the law stands, a U.S. citizen could be fined $1,000.00 for erecting a permitted sign on his front lawn reading only, \"America the Beautiful\", in Tagalog. Does this violate his freedom of expression?</p>\n    <p id=\"b111-8\">That all permitted signs are illegal per se if not in English or Chamorro or without a translation into either, is contradictory to the most basic right of a democratic society - the First Amendment right to freedom of speech.</p>\n    <p id=\"b112-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>The Court has no alternative but to find \u00a717402 and \u00a717402.1 unconstitutional being not in conformity with constitutional provisions as made applicable to Guam by the Organic Act.</p>\n    <p id=\"b112-3\">This case is hereby dismissed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Hearing was had on the issue of a preliminary injunction between November 5 and 13, 1979. On November 21 the preliminary injunction issued.</p>\n    <p id=\"b123-12\">Thereafter, all parties met in chambers on November 29, 1979. At the request of the parties, the court agreed that it would hear the matter as a declaratory judgment action on the record and briefs of the preliminary injunction hearing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> should the parties by stipulation settle the damage and injunctive relief aspects of the case. Although the parties requested the court take this course of action so as to decide the matter expeditiously and save public monies due to the rising cost of construction of the airport which is the subject matter of this litigation, it was not until December 27, 1979 that such a stipulation was filed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b123-13\">This stipulation provided that plaintiffs dismiss their damage claims and that defendant Guam Airport Authority act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>under its reserved power in the contract documents to reject all bids for construction of the Airport Facility, thus mooting the claim for injunctive relief. The matter was thereupon submitted to the court for a declaratory judgment on the applicability and effect of Sections 1 thought 3 of Public Law 14-8 (which provides a bid credit for contractors who limit employment of nonresident aliens below a certain percentage on public works contracts) and Section 25 of Public Law 15-66 (which restricts an employer with more than 40% nonresident alien workers from being awarded a public works contracts). As the validity of Public Law 14-8 and Public Law 15-66 was not briefed or argued in the preliminary injunction hearing, the parties were given until January 11, 1980 to brief this issue, and the matter was submitted.</p>\n    <p id=\"b124-3\">Although the bid award which was the subject matter of this action has been withdrawn, there remains a real and actual controversy as to the effect and applicability of these statutes to any rebid of the project. Because of our determination that these statutes are void and violative of the Organic Act of Guam, it is not necessary to state the specific questions presented beyond the first: Are Public Laws 14-8 Sections 1-3 and 15-66 Section 25 valid and legally enforceable? We \u25a0 turn now to the merits.</p>\n    <p id=\"b124-5\">Public Laws 14-8:1-3 and 15-66:25 exceed the legislative power granted the Government of Guam by the Organic Act and are thus void. 48 U.S.C. 1423(a) provides the standard which circumscribes any exercise of power by the Guam Legislature: \"The legislative power of Guam shall extend to all subjects of legislation of local application not inconsistent with the provisions of this' chapter and the United States applicable to Guam.\" Judged by this standard, these questioned statutes must fall on three distinct grounds.</p>\n    <p id=\"b124-6\">I. PUBLIC LAW 14-8 SECTIONS 1-3 AND PUBLIC LAW 15-66 SECTION 25 ARE NOT CONCERNED WITH A SUBJECT OF LOCAL APPLICATION.</p>\n    <p id=\"b124-7\">Public Law 15-66 disqualifies a contractor who has more than a stated percentage of nonresident alien workers from receiving certain contracts from the Government of Guam. As the Supreme Court said of a similar statute which set a limit on the percentage of alien workers which might be employed by a private employer, \"the act undertakes to operate directly upon the employment of aliens, and if enforced would compel the employer to discharge a sufficient number of his employees to bring the alien quota within the prescribed limit.\" Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 38, 36 S.Ct. 9 (1915).</p>\n    <p id=\"b124-8\">Similarly, Public Law 14-8 operates to discourage the employment of nonresident aliens, albeit by giving financial incentives to employers who discriminate against nonresident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>aliens rather than penalizing the employer of nonresident aliens. The purpose of Public Law 14-8 is stated in Section 2 of the bill: \"In order to induce contractors to hire more United States citizens and permanent residents. ...\" As the bill's sponsor, Senator Charfauros put it: \"by hiring local people . . . you get advantage in the bidding process and I think that . . . this is just one step in reducing our alien workforce . . . .\"<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The legislative intent is clearly to affect the employment of nonresident aliens:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b125-4\">The authority to control immigration - to admit or exclude aliens - is vested solely in the Federal Government. Fong Yue Ting v. U.S., 149 U.S. 698, 713, 13 S.Ct 1016. The assertion of an authority to deny to aliens the opportunity of earning a livelihood when lawfully admitted to the state would be tantamount to the assertion of the right to deny them entrance and abode, for in ordinary cases they cannot live where they cannot work. And, if such a policy were permissible, the practical result would be that those lawfully admitted to the country under the authority of the Acts of Congress, instead of enjoying in a substantial sense and in their full scope the privileges conferred by the admission, would be segregated in such of the states as chose to offer hospitality. Truax, supra, 239 U.S. at 42, 36 S.Ct. at 11.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b125-5\">What Truax says regarding the states is no less true of the Territory of Guam, for neither 48 U.S.C. 1423(a) nor any other Federal Statute shows any intent to delegate this exclusive Federal power to Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b125-6\">\"Local interest\" has long been a word of art in the realm of the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, Clause 4, the Supremacy Clause as it applies to the states. For local interests, the several states of the Union exist; but for international purposes, embracing our relations with foreign nations, we are but one people, one nation, one power.\" Chai Chin Ping vs. U.S., 130 U.S. 581, 606, 9 S.Ct. 623, 630 (1889), Fong Yue Ting vs. U.S., 149 U.S. 698, 706, 13 S.Ct. 1016, 1019 (1893). Acts such as these which operate to discriminate against aliens do do not concern a subject matter which is of local interest. Rather, they operate in an area which is of particular national interest. These acts must therefore be held violative of 48 U.S.C. 1423(a).</p>\n    <p id=\"b126-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>II. PUBLIC LAW 14-8 SECTION 1-3 AND PUBLIC LAW 15-66 SECTION 25 ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES APPLICABLE TO GUAM, AND THUS VIOLATE 48 U.S.C. 1423(a).</p>\n    <p id=\"A6t\">In the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 as amended (8 U.S.C. \u00a71101 et seq.) Congress has regulated the entry of nonresident alien workers. As the California Supreme Court put in in unanimously striking down a state law restricting the right to public employment by aliens:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b126-3\">In light of the comprehensive federal scheme for dealing with the admission of aliens who seek to enter the American labor market, any state [territorial] legislation affecting this same subject matter runs a high risk of conflict with the supreme law .... Moreover, [the] section interferes with the federal scheme for admission of nonimmigrants to perform temporary but essential services in this country; regardless of the national interest at stake . . . California [Guam] prevents such persons from performing otherwise valuable services simply because they labor on public works. Purdy and Fitzpatrick vs. State of California, 71 C.2d 566, 575, 456 P.2d 645 (1969).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b126-4\">The specific concern of these statutes is the nonresident alien worker, often referred to as an \"H-2\" worker because the reference to such workers in the definitions section to 8 U.S.C. is contained in \u00a71101(a)(15)(H)(ii). Such a person is precluded from entering the U.S.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b126-5\">. . . for the purpose of performing skilled or unskilled labor, unless the Secretary of Labor has determined and certified to the Secretary of State and the Attorney General that (A) there are not sufficient workers who are able, willing, qualified (or equally qualified in the case of aliens who are members of the teaching profession or who have exceptional ability in the sciences or the arts), and available at the time of application for a visa and admission to the United States and at the place where the alien is to perform such skilled or unskilled labor, and (B) the employment of such aliens will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of the workers in the United States similarly employed. 8U.S.C. 1182(a)(14).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b126-6\">The Immigration Act is made applicable to Guam. 8 U.S.C. 1101 (a)(36). Thus these acts which deny employment to nonresident aliens after the Secretary of Labor certifies that there is a need for them in this area and that it will not adversely affect wages must be seen as \"inconsistent with the laws of the United States applicable to Guam,\" (48 U.S.C. 1423(a)) and invalid.</p>\n    <p id=\"b127-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>III. PUBLIC LAW 14-8 SECTION 1-3 AND PUBLIC LAW 15-66 SECTION 25 ARE VIOLATIVE OF THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT, MADE APPLICABLE TO GUAM BY 48 U.S.C. 1421(b)(u).</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b127-4\">The Fourteenth Amendment and the laws adopted under its authority thus embody a general policy that all persons lawfully in this country shall abide \"in any state\" on an equality of legal privileges with all citizens under non-discriminatory laws. Takahashi vs. Fish and Game Comm'n., 334 U.S. 410, 420, 68 S.Ct. 1138, 1143 (1948).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b127-5\">It has long been settled that aliens are 'persons' for the purposes of the equal protection and due process of law clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 48 U.S.C. 1421(b)(u) extends the equal protection clause to the Territory of Guam and states that it \"shall have the same force and effect there as in the United States or in any State.\"</p>\n    <p id=\"b127-6\">Decisions of the United States Supreme Court \"have established that classifications based on alienage, like those based on nationality or race, are inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny.\"<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \"Not only must the classification reasonably relate to the purposes of the law, but also the state must bear the burden of establishing that the classification constitutes a necessary means of accomplishing a legitimate state interest, and that the law serves to promote a compelling state interest. \"<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n    <p id=\"b127-7\">Before turning to apply this standard to the statutes under question, it first must be noted that the statutes do not operate against all aliens, but rather favor citizens and resident aliens over nonresident aliens. In such a case involving discrimination between classes of aliens, is strict scrutiny still the applicable test?</p>\n    <p id=\"b127-8\">The Supreme Court has answered this question in the affirmative. \"Appellants claim [the statute] should not be subjected to such strict scrutiny because it does not impose a classification based on alienage. [I]t is said the statute distinguishes 'only within the \"heterogeneous\" class of aliens' and does not distinguish between citizens and aliens vel non.' [The] important points are that [the statute] is directed at aliens and that only aliens are harmed by it. The fact that the statute is not an absolute bar does not mean that it does not discriminate against the class.\"<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n    <p id=\"b127-10\">The standard by which these statutes must be judged is strict scrutiny. But as the Supreme Court said in invalidating a Puerto Rico statute which discriminated against foreign engineers:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b128-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>We do not suggest, however, that a State, Territory, or local government, or certainly the Federal Government may not be permitted some discretion in determining the circumstances under which it will employ aliens or whether aliens may receive public benefits or partake of public resources on the same basis as citizens. In each case, the governmental interest claimed to justify the discrimination is to be carefully examined in order to determine whether that interest is legitimate and substantial, and. inquiry must be made whether the means adopted to achieve the goal are necessary and precisely drawn.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b128-3\">We turn then to the governmental interests which are claimed to justify these acts.</p>\n    <p id=\"b128-4\">First, the legislative history indicates a concern with protecting citizens and resident aliens from nonresident alien economic competition. But as these nonresident aliens are 'persons' within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, \"[sjuch a purpose constitutes prima facie discrimination for its own sake; and if the state sought truly effective protection against alien economic competition by extending a prohibition or limitation against all types of alien employment, such a scheme would clearly offend equal protection.\"<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n    <p id=\"b128-5\">\"May the [territory] simply favor its own citizens in the disbursement of public funds? First, since [nonresident] aliens support the [territory] with their tax dollars, any preference in the disbursement of public funds which excludes [nonresident] aliens appears manifestly unfair. Second, [the statute] prevents [nonresident] aliens from receiving the federal funds which largely support the construction of our highways and other projects; the [territory] can urge no claim to a proprietary interest in such federal funds. Finally, any classification which treats all [nonresident] aliens as undeserving and all United States citizens [and resident aliens] as deserving rests upon a very questionable basis.\"<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n    <p id=\"b128-6\">Concern with local employment is certainly a rational concern of a local legislature. But these statutes favor a resident alien or citizen who may be domiciled in Hawaii or California over a non-resident alien who may already be present in Guam. And as noted supra, before admission of a nonresident alien, the Department of Labor has already determined administratively that there are not sufficient local laborers. Having used a suspect classification to produce such a result, it cannot be held that these statutes serve a compelling territorial interest, that this classification reasonably relates to the purpose of the law. or that such a classification is a necessary means of accomplishing a legitimate state interest. We note the fact that the territory has the means to address the problem of local employment in the construction trades in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>variety of ways other than a discriminatory classification, such as the requirement that bidders have apprenticeship and training programs, which was contained in Public Law 14-8.</p>\n    <p id=\"b129-3\">Judged by the strict scrutiny standard. Public Law 14-8:1-3 and Public Law 15-66:25 must clearly be held invalid as violative of equal protection.</p>\n    <p id=\"b129-4\">The Court feels that it is worthwhile to add two final notes. First, Public Law 14-8 had a saving clause:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b129-5\">Section 8. Severability. If any provision of Sections 1 to 3 of this Act or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the act which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of these sections are severable.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b129-6\">The Court has attempted in vain to reach a construction of Public Law 14-8 which would sever and save that portion of the act which is non-discriminatory and does not impede on federal concerns: the requirement of apprenticeship and training programs for the bid credits. This requirement was a predicate for each of the bid credits based on different discriminatory percentages. The court has been unable to say that the granting of any of the bid credits for the apprenticeship requirement alone would reflect the intent of the legislature, and must strike down the sections in their entirety.</p>\n    <p id=\"b129-8\">Finally, as may be noted from the jurisdictions which have struggled with this problem, how to deal with alien labor is not a problem unique to Guam. We cite and adapt the language of the California Supreme Court when it was required to strike down similar legislation:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b129-9\">[Guam] need not, however, abandon its concern for the state labor market. The gross remedy of [P.L. 14-3 and P.L. 15-66] may not stand, but the [territory] may and should inform the Secretary of Labor and other federal officials concerning the labor conditions within [Guam] and within particular industries and occupations. [Guam] does not remain, therefore, without power to act, but merely without power to act with final authority upon a matter for which Congress has determined that one national policy administered by the federal government should prevail.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b129-10\">Footnotes:</p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n      <p id=\"b129-11\">.

The sole issue before us is whether the affidavit and the testimony given to the judge issuing the search warrant were legally sufficient. We find that they were and we reverse the Order granting the motion to suppress.</p>\n    <p id=\"b175-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>The affidavit cites the experience of affiant Rodney G. Klinge as a police officer, specifically in narcotics investigation, his acquaintanceship and experience with an unidentified informer, \"CRI\", and the affiant's belief of his reliability. There are also fairly specific assertions in the affidavit regarding a controlled buy of heroin by the \"CRI\" at Defendant Rico's residence. Based on the above, Officer Klinge stated that there was probable cause to believe that heroin was located at the Rico residence.</p>\n    <p id=\"b175-3\">The testimony before the Judge issuing the search was in a little more detail about the controlled buy at Rico's. After the search warrant was issued, a search of Defendant\u2019s house produced no narcotics but a firearm was found in the house.</p>\n    <p id=\"b175-4\">The Trial Court granted the motion to suppress on the grounds that (1) they made by the \"CRI\" was not a supervised buy about which Officer Klinge was competent to testify from firsthand knowledge and (2) there was not presented sufficient showing that the \"CRI\" was reliable.</p>\n    <p id=\"b175-5\">Appellee concedes that hearsay evidence may properly be considered by a magistrate in issuing a search warrant, so long as there is a substantial basis for believing the hearsay to be credible. McCray v. Illinois, 386 U.S. 300, 87 S.Ct. 1056, 18 L.Ed 2d 62. reh. den. 386 U.S. 1042, 87 S.Ct. 1478, 18 L.Ed. 2nd 616. When the affidavit is not based on direct personal observation of the affiant, the judge issuing the search warrant must be informed of some of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concludes that the informant is credible or his information reliable. Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108 , 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed. 2nd 723.</p>\n    <p id=\"b175-6\">It was only after the Trial Court took additional testimony at the hearing to suppress that it found the Rico residence is located where numerous other dwelling houses were located. Be that as it may, this does not alter the original information presented to the issuing magistrate. The Trial Court did not find (nor is there anything in the record to so indicate) that there is a false statement in the affidavit or testimony of Officer Klinge or that Klinge demonstrated reckless disregard for the truth which would require an evidentiary hearing. Franks v. Delaware, 98 S.Ct. 2674. There is a presumption of validity with respect to the affidavit supporting the search warrant. If, after setting aside any material that is the subject of the charge of falsity or reckless disregard of the truth, there is sufficient content in the warrant affidavit to support a finding of probable cause, an evidentiary hearing is not even required. Franks v. Delaware, supra.</p>\n    <p id=\"b175-7\">As noted above, after an evidentiary hearing the trial court found as a fact that the previous buy at Rico's house 36 hours before seeking a warrant was not made under such strict supervision of the police that it provided probable cause for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>issuance of a search warrant. However, the narrow issue presented by this appeal is whether the warrant was issued upon information furnished by a reliable informant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b176-3\">The Affidavit in support of the subject Search Warrant recited that \"CRI\" was known to affiant police officer to be reliable because he had made two previous buys of narcotics under affiant's supervision and control. This condensed statement of the contents of the Affidavit is sufficient to point out that \"CRI\" had given information to the police concerning two buys before the one at Rico's house and furnished information which had never been found to be inaccurate. In other words the experience of the police with \"CRI\" was that he could be relied upon to give accurate information. In language often used by the courts, \"CRI\" was known to be a reliable informant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b176-4\">The Affidavit showed that in the two previous buys made by \"CRI\" under <em>Officer </em>Klinge's \"supervision and control\", \"CRI\" was out of Klinge's sight for several minutes. It is a fair inference from the Affidavit that after each previous buy \"CRI\" returned to Klinge and gave him information concerning events occurring while \"CRI\" was out of Klinge's sight. Otherwise \"CRI\" would not have been referred to as an informant. Had \"CRI\" never been out of Klinge's sight, the officer would have had no reason to rely upon \"CRI\" since his knowledge would have been based upon his personal observation and \"CRI\" could not have been classified as an informant. Contrary to the trial court's conclusion that Klinge was not competent to testify from first hand knowledge, his affidavit recited first hand knowledge of the reliability of \"CRI\" on two previous occasions. This was the evidence before the magistrate issuing the warrant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b176-5\">Of course it is for the judge authorizing the warrant to find the facts from the evidence submitted in affidavit form. If the warrant issued upon a showing of fact which was inherently incredible or false or deliberately misleading, the warrant was issued without probable cause. However, no showing of this kind was made in the trial court. The trial judge erroneously substituted his own view of the facts for that of the issuing officer after taking evidence which was not relative to the issue of the reliability of \"CRI\" as an informant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b176-6\">Affidavit for search warrants must be tested and interpreted by magistrates and courts in a common sense and realistic fashion, and technical requirements of elaborate specificity are no longer required. U.S. v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 85 S.Ct. 741.</p>\n    <p id=\"b176-7\">After reading the affidavit and the transcript of the testimony of Officer Klinge, we find that the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>presented to the judge issuing the search warrant meets the requirements specified above.</p>\n    <p id=\"b177-3\">The Order granting the motion to suppress the weapon is REVERSED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Judgment by default was entered against Mrs. Roper on January 7, 1980. this was set aside on February 22, 1980. Next, plaintiff moved for summary judgment against Robert Roper on February 6 on the grounds that the material contained in this request for admissions filed November 30, 1979 had not been answered and were therefore admitted.- The judgment was denied but a request by Defendant Robert Roper to file answers to admissions was also denied at that time. Trial took place on March 25 with argument on March 26, 1980.</p>\n    <p id=\"b22-7\">The ownership of the rings found by Mrs. Roper is, as counsel for both sides agree, the crux of this case.</p>\n    <p id=\"b22-8\">The court having sat as fact finder and having weighed both the credibility and interest of the witnesses, finds that the probability is overwhelming that the rings found by Mrs. Roper are those lost by Mrs. Campbell. The situs at the Andersen Air Force Base Plaza, the time frame of disappearing and finding of the rings, the gross similarities in design (whatever the recollection of minute differences may be), the undisputed bend in the engagement ring, all militate against the possible coincidence that two sets of rings were in issue here.</p>\n    <p id=\"b22-9\">The Court hereby makes and files its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.</p>\n    <p id=\"b23-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>FINDINGS OF FACT: Plaintiff David Campbell purchased a set of rings in November 1978 for $777.00. The rings were set with diamonds and made to be worn together and present a single design.</p>\n    <p id=\"b23-4\">David Campbell, in December 1978, and in June 1979, gave those rings to Stephanie Campbell. While in Guam in July 1979, one of the rings was bent in a mishap.</p>\n    <p id=\"b23-5\">On or about 31 August at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, Stephanie Campbell lost the rings in the ladies' restroom near her place of business. Mrs. Campbell personally searched for the rings and notified the Security Lost and Found, the managers of stores in the Plaza, and certain persons with whom she worked. It is not indicated that she posted a notice or advertised in the base newspaper.</p>\n    <p id=\"b23-6\">About the end of August or beginning of September Mrs. Roper found a ring set designed with diamonds, one of the bands being bent, in the ladies' restroom near her place of employment at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b23-7\">The ring set found by Mrs. Roper on or about the end of August, beginning of September was the ring set lost by Mrs. Campbell.</p>\n    <p id=\"b23-8\">Mrs. Roper made no attempt to place the rings in the custody of police or base authorities or to advertise them. Mrs. Roper kept the rings in her possession, unadvertised, for a period of approximately two weeks. She did exhibit them to friends.</p>\n    <p id=\"b23-9\">Mrs. Roper sold the rings for $80.00 an unidentified person who took possession after giving a check to Mrs. Roper. This occurred approximately two weeks after the rings were found.</p>\n    <p id=\"b23-10\">Mrs. Roper did not consult with her husband, nor receive guidance from him in the disposition of the rings she found. He cooperated in their sale only by cashing the check for her and immediately gave her the money.</p>\n    <p id=\"b23-11\">After the rings were sold mutual acquaintances advised Mrs. Roper that Mrs. Campbell had lost a ring set. This was Mrs. Roper's first knowledge of a specific claimant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b23-12\">A series of three confrontations between Mrs. Campbell and Mrs. Roper and a meeting between Mr. Roper and Mr. Campbell took place with regard to identification of the rings in question. That Plaintiff was calm and showed no signs of disturbance at them. These occurred within three months of the time of finding of the rings.</p>\n    <p id=\"b23-13\">Mrs. Campbell was willing to reimburse and even reward the finder of her rings. Mrs. Roper, accompanied by her husband, attempted to contact the person who has purchased the rings to clarify the situation as to original ownership. Their attempt was unsuccessful.</p>\n    <p id=\"b23-14\">Mr. and Mrs. Campbell retained counsel to represent them in an action for damages regarding the incident. Initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>retainer was $250.00 with one-third of the recovered sum remaining to be paid to counsel if the suit is successful.</p>\n    <p id=\"b24-3\">The following Conclusions of Law are reached by the Court:</p>\n    <p id=\"b24-4\">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW: Debra Roper did not comply with the statutory requirements for one who finds property of an unknown owner, and wrongfully exercised ownership over the rings in question by selling them, all within a three month period after finding them, and is therefore liable to the owner of the rings for double their value.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n    <p id=\"b24-6\">The rings are the separate property of Stephanie Campbell, such rings having been given to her by husband, David Campbell.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n    <p id=\"b24-7\">The cooperation admitted by Robert Roper in Paragraph 4 of his admissions, being shown by testimony as mere negotiation of the check, is insufficient to establish statutory liability.</p>\n    <p id=\"b24-8\">The Actions of Mrs. Roper in disposing of the rings without advertising or further attempting to determine ownership when coupled with her actions in seeking to locate the buyer do not show malice (rather cupidity) and do not constitute a basis for punitive damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n    <p id=\"b24-9\">The mental anguish testified to by Plaintiff cannot be assessed from evidence received and is therefore deemed nominal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n    <p id=\"b24-10\">DECISION: Judgment will be entered for Defendants Robert Roper and Debra Roper against Plaintiff David Campbell.</p>\n    <p id=\"b24-12\">Judgment will be entered for Defendant Robert Roper against Plaintiff Stephanie Campbell.</p>\n    <p id=\"b24-13\">Judgment will be entered for Plaintiff Stephanie Campbell against Defendant Debra Roper in the amount of $1554.00 plus nominal damages for mental anguish of $50.00.</p>\n    <p id=\"b24-14\">Attorney's fees denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b24-15\">Costs to be assessed against Defendant Debra Roper.</p>\n    <p id=\"b24-16\">Footnotes:</p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n      <p id=\"b24-17\">Section 1865 - 1872 - Civil Code of Guam.</p>\n    </footnote>\n    <footnote label=\"2\">\n      <p id=\"b24-18\">Section 162 - Civil Code of Guam.</p>\n    </footnote>\n    <footnote label=\"3\">\n      <p id=\"b24-19\">Section 3294 - Civil Code of Guam.</p>\n    </footnote>\n    <footnote label=\"4\">\n      <p id=\"b24-20\">Section 3360 - Civil Code of Guam.</p>\n    </footnote>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Section 938 of the Guam Civil Code provides in part that \"Any party aggrieved may appeal in the cases prescribed in this Title.\" See 4 Cal.Jur.3d, Appellate Review, \u00a7102, for an interpretation of the identical California statute. In addition to the weight to be given to this statutory alteration of the <em>common </em>law, it should be noted that the settlement agreement in question concerns several individual rights and obligations which are distinct from any joint venture or partnership relationships.</p>\n    <p id=\"b182-11\">First, we agree with the defendants-appellants that the court committed error when it held that upon sale of the property in question the plaintiffs only had to pay Ten Thousand Dollars and then pay the remaining Ten Thousand Dollars in two yearly installments of Five Thousand Dollars. This order was in direct contradiction to the representation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>made when the parties informed the court of their settlement agreement:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b183-3\">\"Mr. Haut [counsel for plaintiffs]: In exchange on the part of the Defendants, the Plaintiffs will execute two (2) promissory notes. The promissory note in favor of Guam United Trading and Financing Company [the appellant] in the amount of $20,000 with terms to be decided upon between counsel for the parties as we get into the process of drafting that, payable in ten (10) years or at the sale of the property in question, whichever comes first. Second, the Plaintiffs will execute a promissory note in the name of Defendant Hechanova for $10,000 on the same terms, payable in ten (10) years or if the property was sold, whichever comes first. That covers the law suit and that takes care of that. (Transcript, Exhibit 1 to Plaintiffs' Motion to compel. Emphasis Supplied.)</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b183-6\">Second, we must determine whether or not the court should have provided for a mortgage in favor of the defendants so that their right to secure payments due them under the settlement agreement would be protected. While it is true that the question of a mortgage was never discussed by the parties in open court, it seems very unlikely that any party would contemplate transferring over an interest in realty without an adequate security interest. In the normal course of business dealings, a mortgage or some similar security interest would be expected, and it is the opinion of this Court that granting a mortgage in favor of the defendants would do less violence to the intention of the parties, while at the same time protecting defendant's equitable interests in the property which it was conveying.</p>\n    <p id=\"b183-7\">The plaintiffs have argued that as an appellate court we should not disturb the express findings of the trial court unless they are clearly erroneous. However, here it seems clear that the trial court chose to ignore certain representations made in open court as to the terms of immediate payment upon the sale of the property in question. Also, the normal presumption that a seller of realty will require a mortgage or security agreement, made it necessary for the trial court to include such a mortgage requirement in its order to compel settlement.</p>\n    <p id=\"b183-8\">Based on the analysis above, the January 8, 1979 Order of the Superior Court compelling settlement in the above-captioned case is vacated, with directions to the Court to file a new order consistent with this Opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n    <p id=\"b184-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Reversed and remanded.</p>\n    <p id=\"b184-3\">Footnote:</p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n      <p id=\"b184-4\">. A comment about the appeal record is appropriate here, especially in light of the recent amendment to the District Court Rules of Appellate Procedure stating that sanctions will be imposed against counsel who unreasonably order excessive parts of the record (Rule 8(b)). The several hundred page glut which made up the record in this case was totally unnecessary; based on the one issue on appeal, a record several pages long was all that was required. Ironically enough, the one key portion of the trial hearing relative to appeal was not even included in the transcripts which were transmitted from the Superior Court. Had the new Rules of Appellate Procedure been in effect during the pendency of this appeal, sanctions against the responsible attorneys would have been appropriate.</p>\n    </footnote>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The plaintiff and defendant appeared in person and with counsel.</p>\n    <p id=\"b81-5\">PLEADINGS: A complaint of negligence arising out of an automobile collision is the basis for this action. A counterclaim was filed also alleging liability and damages.</p>\n    <p id=\"b81-7\">The witnesses who testified included a child passenger and the driver of plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the accident and the investigating officer who arrived after the collision. Others testified regarding damages to plaintiff's car and defendant put on testimony regarding the condition of the Hospital Road at the time of the accident.</p>\n    <p id=\"b81-8\">FINDINGS AND FACTS: 1. The defendant's vehicle had used and turned from properly marked public roadway onto a construction area at the entrance to Saehan's.</p>\n    <p id=\"b81-10\">2. The plaintiff was using as a roadway the unpaved construction area adjacent to the highway.</p>\n    <p id=\"b81-11\">3. The plaintiff had access to the public roadway prior to the spot of the accident but chose to remain on the unpaved construction and \"take his chances\".</p>\n    <p id=\"b81-12\">4. There is no credible evidence that the vehicle turning into the construction area (defendant's) was going at excessive speed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b81-13\">5. There is no evidence that the plaintiff's car was going at excessive speed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b81-15\">6. The plaintiff's driver saw the vehicle of the defendant in the construction area crossing through to Saehan's before the collision and testified that he had time to maneuver \u2018 his vehicle.</p>\n    <p id=\"b81-16\">7. The driver of the plaintiff's vehicle offered to repair the damages to the vehicle.</p>\n    <p id=\"b81-17\">8. There is no evidence of damage to defendant's vehicle.</p>\n    <p id=\"b81-19\">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW: Section 23127.1(b) [Government (Vehicle) Code] is to be read in the light of subsection (a) of the same section. The language there makes it clear that the approaching traffic to be given the right of way is the traffic on the highway, therefore it is not applicable to the situation here where the plaintiff's vehicle was in a construction area off the highway.</p>\n    <p id=\"A5A\">The is no substantial evidence of negligence on the part of the driver of defendant's car.</p>\n    <p id=\"b82-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>The damages to plaintiff's car are not attributable to defendant, and plaintiff therefore is not entitled to damages from defendant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b82-3\">The Court has no evidence before it to allow judgment on the counterclaim and cannot do so.</p>\n    <p id=\"b82-4\">Attorney for defendant is requested to submit a proposed judgment, approved as to form or seen by the other attorney.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Defendant University of Guam is the instrumentality under the laws of Guam responsible for administration of the University facilities in Mangilao, Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b87-16\">JURISDICTION: Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to Section 82 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Guam and injunctive relief is sought pursuant to Rule 65 of the Guam Rule of Civil Procedure.</p>\n    <p id=\"b88-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>BACKGROUND: In September 1979, plaintiff left Guam on study leave to attend Washington State University. On 28 September, he withdrew from the University course. He asserts that program was not the one he intended to enter. The University asserts (Exhibit A to their brief) that he was specifically instructed to remain. On 20 of October a notice of proposed adverse action was issued indicating that the University intended to dismiss him as an employee for \"gross insubordination\" and inviting him to submit an answer to the notice within 20 days, either in person or in writing and also affidavits, if he wished. He was simultaneously suspended.</p>\n    <p id=\"b88-4\">On 5 December, plaintiff filed this action alleging that for the University to go forward in this manner was a violation of his right to due process. Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgement regarding the parties' rights and enjoining of further action by the University until rules of procedure for such a dismissal action are promulgated.</p>\n    <p id=\"b88-5\">Defendant alleges that due process is met by the present notice with opportunity to respond (Exhibit A) and that in any event an employee in plaintiff's category may be dismissed summarily.</p>\n    <p id=\"b88-6\">The traditional guidelines to injunctive relief are:</p>\n    <p id=\"b88-7\">1) the significance of the threat of irreparable harm to plaintiff if the injunction is not granted.</p>\n    <p id=\"b88-8\">2) the state of the balance between this harm and the injury that granting the injunction would inflict on defendant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b88-9\">3) the probability that plaintiff will succeed on the merits.</p>\n    <p id=\"b88-10\">4) the public interest<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.</p>\n    <p id=\"b88-11\">Firstly, the Court rejects defendant's argument that the plaintiff's application for injunctive relief is premature; although indeed the decision to terminate has not been made as of this date, the wording of the Notice of Proposed Adverse Action indicates a reasonable probability that the plaintiff will be fired. The very purpose of an injunction is to prevent a threatened action.</p>\n    <p id=\"b88-12\">Considering defendant's response to the application in the order given, the first argument is based on the premise that an untenured employee can be summarily fired. In support of this, defendant cites Board of Regents of State College v. Roth, 92 S. Ct. 2701.</p>\n    <p id=\"b88-13\">That case however differs from the fact situation before us. Roth dealt with the nonhiring of a nontenured employee for a subsequent year. As pointed out in Burdeau v. Trustee of California State Colleges, 507 F.2d 770 , 773, citing Roth, releasing someone for named charges even if they are not criminal charges, is indeed a different situation from a mere failure to renew a contract. \"Where a person's good name. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to him, notice and an opportunity to be heard are essential\" Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 91 S. Ct. 507 (1971).</p>\n    <p id=\"b89-3\">The Court next considers what the plaintiff has available to him as a hearing and whether it fulfills due process requirements.</p>\n    <p id=\"b89-4\">Executive Order 72-19 sets out as policy the Rules and Regulations Relative to Demotion, Suspension, Dismissal and Appeal of such Adverse Actions.</p>\n    <p id=\"b89-5\">Plaintiff's counsel has asserted orally and in his answering memorandum that the Rules and Regulations of Executive Order 72-19 are not mandated for the University but says that the defendant's acknowledgment of the rules as the procedural guidelines for the hearing would safeguard his client.</p>\n    <p id=\"b89-6\">In response to a query of plaintiff as to whether the University had adopted Executive Order 72-19, counsel for the Board of Regents said, quoting from Rule XIV of Government of Guam Rules and Regulations which it is undisputed have been adopted by the Board of Regents as their interim operating rules under \u00a711841 of its enabling legislation:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b89-7\">\"MR. RODGERS: It says in Rule 14, \"Pursuant to \u2014 \" Excuse me, \"The right to appeal to the Civil Service Commission as provided in the Civil Service Rules and Regulations relative to demotions, suspensions, dismissals--\" and so forth. By adopting these rules and regulations, it certainly has adopted the Civil Service rules regarding demotions, dismissals and so forth.\"</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b89-8\">The Court accepts defendant's assertion that these Rules and Regulations of Executive Order 72-19 are procedural safeguards available to plaintiff.</p>\n    <p id=\"b89-9\">This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties.</p>\n    <p id=\"b89-10\">There is no evidence that summary dismissal of plaintiff is being considered.</p>\n    <p id=\"b89-11\">Counsel for defendant has represented to Court that the very procedure that plaintiff wished is integrated into the rules governing a hearing.</p>\n    <p id=\"b89-12\">The foregoing constitute Finding of Facts and Conclusions of Law pursuant to Rule 52(a), Rules of Civil Procedure for the Superior Court of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b90-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>The requested Rules being used, there is no danger of irreparable injury to plaintiff, therefore the request for injunctive relief should be and the same is hereby denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b90-3\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b90-4\">Footnote:</p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n      <p id=\"b90-5\">.

GOVERNMENT OF GUAM, Defendant</parties>\n  <docketnumber id=\"b95-8\">Civil No. 795-76</docketnumber>\n  <court id=\"ARp\">Superior Court of Guam</court>\n  <decisiondate id=\"A7j\">March 6, 1980</decisiondate>\n  <opinion type=\"majority\">\n    <author id=\"b96-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>RAKER, Judge</author>\n    <p id=\"b96-6\">DECISION</p>\n    <p id=\"b96-7\">This is a complaint filed on September 17, 1976, based on an employment contract between plaintiff Alexander Kent and defendant Government of Guam. The contract, Exhibit 7, provided that the contract shall be effective November 23, 1974 for a period of one year. The position as Assistant Special Prosecutor and carried an annual salary of $27,040.00, increased to $35,000.00, Exhibit A. Count One demanded $6,732.00 for the contract period September 13, 1975 to November 23, 1975. Count Two demanded $3,768.22 for retroactive pay at the rate of $35,000.00 for the period November 23, 1974 to May 15, 1975. No evidence was presented by the plaintiff to justify the claim for retroactive pay. The plaintiff performed his duties from November 23, 1974 through September 12, 1975. On July 23, 1975, Public Law 13-53 became effective. This act pertinent part:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b96-10\">a. Abolished the Office of Independent Special Prosecutor and repealed Public Law 12-173, Section 4.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b96-11\">b. Appropriated funds for the Office of Independent Special Prosecutor for the period July 1, 1975 through September 12, 1975, Section 3.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b96-14\">Plaintiff was aware in late July, 1975 that he would not be paid after September 13, 1975. Plaintiff was not paid for that part of the contract period from September 13, 1975 to November 23, 1975, and on September 22, 1975, filed a claim under the Government of Guam Claims Act, \u00a76500 et. seq., of the Government Code of Guam for payment under his contract for the period September 13, 1975 to November 23, 1975 and for retroactive pay.</p>\n    <p id=\"b96-16\">On December 3, 1975, defendant by registered mail addressed to plaintiff notified him that his claim was denied. This denial of claim was received by plaintiff on December 8, 1975. Defendant failed to notify his attorney that the claim had been denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b97-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>On December 30, 1975, counsel for plaintiff wrote to the Attorney General requesting what disposition, if any, had been made of the claim. On December 31, 1975, the Attorney General replied requesting a copy of the plaintiff's claim. Exhibit 14.</p>\n    <p id=\"b97-3\">The Attorney General never notified counsel for plaintiff that the claim had been denied. Plaintiff performed no services under the contract and was not gainfully employed during the period of September 13, 1975 to November 23, 1975.</p>\n    <p id=\"b97-4\">There is apparently no dispute between the parties as to the facts stated. However, three legal issues are contested as follows:</p>\n    <p id=\"b97-5\">1. Is the defendant estopped to raise the defense of statute of limitations, \u00a76500.21 of the Government Code of Guam, which provides as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b97-6\">Statute of limitations. Every action under \u00a76500.11 shall be barred unless commenced within one (1) year from the date the claim was filed with the Attorney General under \u00a76500.03, or within six (6) months from the date of notification of rejection of the claim under \u00a76500.11, whichever is sooner. (Added by P.L. 3-78, effective June 29, 1956; Repealed and added by P.L. 9-175, effective March 14, 1968. Sections 6500.11, 6600.14, and 6500.18 were amended by P.L. 9-256, effective January 8, 1969.)</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b97-7\">2. Is plaintiff's claim based on an invalid contract?</p>\n    <p id=\"b97-8\">3. Is plaintiff's claim barred because of his failure to mitigate damages?</p>\n    <p id=\"b97-9\">ESTOPPEL TO RAISE STATUTE OF LIMITATION: The plaintiffs suit filed on September 17, 1976 is barred by the statute of limitations, quoted above, unless it can be found that the defendant is estopped from raising the defense. Estoppel can be found either by intent ' (fraud) or negligence. 18 Cal.Jur.2d, Estoppel, Sections 10 and 11. There is no evidence that the Government of Guam intended to mislead the plaintiff's attorney. Counsel for plaintiff wrote to the Attorney General on December 30, 1975 requesting that he be advised of the disposition of plaintiff's claim. The Attorney General replied on December 31, 1975 requesting a copy of the claim which had not been enclosed with the letter. The Attorney General failed to respond concerning the disposition of the claim stating that the claim was still under consideration. Plaintiff claims that this failure by defendant estops the defendant from raising the statute of limitations. We will assume that defendant was negligent in failing to respond to the written request of plaintiff's attorney. We must then examine the conduct of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>plaintiff and his attorney to see whether such conduct will permit the defense of estoppel.</p>\n    <p id=\"b98-3\">1. Plaintiff's attorney made only one written request and failed to make an additional written request after a suitable time had elapsed. It is suggested that normal procedure in both business and professions would be a follow-up written request.</p>\n    <p id=\"b98-4\">2. Plaintiff had actual knowledge of the denial of the claim on December 8, 1975 when he received written notification of denial but he never so advised his attorney or forwarded to him the letter of denial of the claim. This is difficult to understand since plaintiff is himself an attorney and should realize that it is essential that a client provide his attorney with all relevant information and documents.</p>\n    <p id=\"b98-7\">The negligence of the plaintiff and his counsel will not permit plaintiff to raise the doctrine of estoppel. 28 Am.Jur. 2d, Estoppel and Waiver, Section 80, pp. 720-723. It is essential that the party asserting the estoppel must have been ignorant of the true state of facts. 18 Cal.Jur.2d, Estoppel, Section 9.</p>\n    <p id=\"b98-8\">Not commented on by counsel for defendant is the rule that when, as here, a statute creates a cause of action when none existed before, and prescribes a limitation of time for bringing suit, the right of action is conditioned on its enforcement within the prescribed period and the defendant may not be estopped from setting up the limitation. 51 Am.Jur. 2d, Limitation of Action, \u00a7435, p. 902. Although this rule is not uniformly followed in some recent cases, the Court feels that it should be followed:</p>\n    <p id=\"b98-9\">1. Where there is absent intentional, misrepresentations by the defendant, and</p>\n    <p id=\"b98-10\">2. Where the plaintiff is himself negligent.</p>\n    <p id=\"b98-11\">The Court has, as noted above, found that defendant made no intentional misrepresentations and plaintiff was himself negligent.</p>\n    <p id=\"b98-12\">The Court concludes that defendant is not estopped from raising the defense of statute of limitations.</p>\n    <p id=\"b98-13\">CLAIM BASED ON INVALID CONTRACT: The Supreme Court of Guam held that the creation of the Office of Special Prosecutor was invalid because it violated the separation of powers provisions of the Organic Act. Territory of Guam v. Camacho, et. al., [1 Guam R. 501] Criminal Case Nos. 37F-75 through 47F-75. A contract cannot be predicated on such a statute and the legislature cannot bind the state by a statute which it has no power to enact. 17 Am.Jur.2d, Contracts, \u00a7165. Where a contract is entered into pursuant to such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>statute it is void and not subject to the prohibition against impairment of contracts set forth in 48 U.S. C.A., \u00a71421b(j).</p>\n    <p id=\"b99-3\">Because the contract under which Mr. Kent claims a right to compensation was entered into under authority of a law which was contrary to the Organic Act and unenforceable, his claim is unenforceable and must be denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b99-4\">The decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the Territory of Guam v. Olsen, 431 U.S.1975, 52 L.Ed. 2d 250 (1977) did not render void the judgment in Camacho. The decision in Olsen decided that the transfer by the Guam Legislature of the District Court's appellate jurisdiction to the Supreme Court of Guam was invalid. The decision did not invalidate the creation of the Court itself or any original jurisdiction assigned to it. See Section 16(a) of Public Law 12-173. Camacho was clearly a case of original jurisdiction brought under Section 16(a) of Public Law 12-173 and thus is not effected by Olsen.</p>\n    <p id=\"b99-5\">Plaintiff claims that he was a public employee and not a public officer and that termination of his employment before the expiration of his one year contract by Public Law 13-153 violated the prohibition against impairment of contracts contained in the Organic Act of Guam, 48 U.S.C.A. 1421(b)(j). Although his original appointment was as Assistant Special Prosecutor, he changed his position to that of a public officer. The last paragraph of his appointment as Special Prosecutor (Exhibit A) reads as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b99-6\">Your term of office shall conform with the provisions of Section 11, Public Law 12-173, or as may be otherwise provided by law.\" Emphasis supplied.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b99-7\">MITIGATION OF DAMAGES: Answers to interrogatories, Exhibit 6, Nos. 2, 3 and 4, indicate:</p>\n    <p id=\"b99-9\">1. That plaintiff made no serious attempt to obtain any other professional employment,</p>\n    <p id=\"b99-10\">2. That such employment was reasonably available at least on Guam, and</p>\n    <p id=\"b99-11\">3. That plaintiff's sole interest at the time of termination was his further formal education in the law.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b99-12\">\"... The commonest example is an employment contract. An employee wrongfully discharged cannot sit idle for the balance of his term and recover the full salary promised. If other employment of a similar kind is available to him in the same locality he must exercise diligence in an effort to procure it, and so utilize the time left on his hands. If he fails to do so, that part of the loss of use of his time results from his own failure to act reasonably, and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>from the defendant's breach. . .\" Simpson on Contracts, 2nd Ed., \u00a7199, p. 403.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b100-3\">The foregoing shall constitute the Court's findings of facts and conclusion of law.</p>\n    <p id=\"b100-4\">Judgment shall be for defendant.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

After oral arguments, the Court reserved decision. At the outset, it is necessary to state the events leading to the dispute. On August 24, 1970, Alejo D. Palting, the grantor and defendant, executed a grant deed with conditions subsequent concerning certain lots, the subject matter of the dispute. Said deed contained two restrictions obligating the grantee, SOHBU GUAM DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, INC., (1) within a reasonable time to commence the construction of permanent improvements on the land conveyed, such improvements to have a value at least equal to the unpaid balance of the purchase price; (2) that until the purchase price is paid in full the grantee shall neither sell, mortgage, or otherwise encumber the said land without the written consent of the grantor. Further, the deed provided a mechanism by which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>the grantor may proceed in his termination rights in case of breach of the above restrictions.</p>\n    <p id=\"b30-3\">Subsequently, Defendant received monthly payments and the final payment was made on August 1, 1975. On August 6, 1979, the Defendant served Plaintiff with a Notice to Perform the Covenant or Quit. (See Exhibit B of this motion). On September 12, 1979, Defendant served Plaintiff with a Notice of Termination. (See Exhibit C).</p>\n    <p id=\"b30-4\">Plaintiff opposed the motion on several grounds; there is a genuine issue of fact since Plaintiff claims the purchase price to be paid off while Defendant avers otherwise; that the restrictions are not necessarily conditions subsequent and that \u00a71442 of the Guam Civil Code operates against Defendant's favor; (3) that Defendant did not exercise his rights within a reasonable period of time.</p>\n    <p id=\"b30-5\">Initially, the court must determine the grantee's duties under the deed. The Court finds that the grantee has two affirmative duties as mandated by the two restrictions hereinbefore mentioned. The Court also finds that the grantee has fully complied with the second restriction concerning the purchase price but the grantee never fulfilled its duty regarding the first restriction; i.e. permanent improvements.</p>\n    <p id=\"b30-6\">The Court will now consider the grantee's oppositional grounds, respectively.</p>\n    <p id=\"b30-7\">The grantee's first ground is there is a genuine factual issue concerning the purchase price, the Court finds no merit to this contention since the grantor has not controverted this fact, contrary to the allegation of grantee's counsel. Furthermore, Defendant's motion is based on the fact that the grantee has failed, entirely, in his duty to commence permanent improvements, notwithstanding notice from the grantor that the latter was electing to exercise his termination rights. Whether an amount remains unpaid, goes only to the extremity of the grantee's duty regarding this restriction.</p>\n    <p id=\"b30-8\">The grantee's second ground of contention is \u00a71442 of the Guam Civil Code dictates that a condition involving a forfeiture must be strictly interpreted against the party for whose benefit it is created. The Court agrees with grantee this is the general rule. However, it is also well settled that an instrument is to be strictly construed against the maker of the instrument. Here the instrument was prepared and drafted by by grantee's attorney. See Page 3 of Andrew Gayle's deposition. Rule 30(e) of the Rules of Civil Procedure for the Superior Court of Guam.. Furthermore, it is well settled that a reversion of title for-, breach of a condition subsequent will not be decreed except upon -clear and satisfactory evidence of a violation of the condition. City of Palo Verdes v. Willett, 75 CA 2d 394, (7) P2d 26; Whittaker v. Regents, et al, 39 Cal. App. 111, 178 P. 308.</p>\n    <p id=\"b31-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>The grantee's final contention is the grantor did not exercise his rights within a reasonable time. It is apparent that the grantee deems four (4) years to be an unreasonably lengthy time. However, it is a matter of law that the fact that the grantor did not assert a right to re-enter for fifteen years after the breach did not operate as an estoppel, or preclude him from insisting upon a forfeiture and claiming possession. Union College v. New York, 173 N.Y. 38, 93 Am. St, Rep. 569, 65 N.E. 853; Lowrey v. Hawaii, (1910) 215 U.S. 554, 30 S. Ct. 209, 54L.Ed.325</p>\n    <p id=\"b31-3\">THEREFORE, IT IS THE FINDING OF THE COURT THAT;</p>\n    <p id=\"b31-4\">1. the grantee did not comply with the provision in the instrument that it shall commence within a reasonable period of time the construction of permanent improvement;</p>\n    <p id=\"b31-5\">2. the grantor has fully complied with the provisions in the instrument outlining the procedure in case of a breach of the condition subsequent,</p>\n    <p id=\"b31-6\">3. the restrictions in dispute are indeed conditions subsequent,</p>\n    <p id=\"b31-7\">4. the grantor exercised his rights within a reasonable period of time, [and]</p>\n    <p id=\"b31-8\">5. the grantee has been in continuing breach, from a reasonable time after the signing of the instrument to the giving of the notice to perform the covenant or quit, of its duty to erect permanent improvements.</p>\n    <p id=\"b31-9\">.

The defense also filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the evidence presented to the grand jury was not sufficient to justify probable cause for the return of the indictment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b85-10\">A hearing was held on November 8, 1979 at 2:00 p.m., the people being represented by Paul Pohlen, Assistant Attorney General and the defendant being represented by Nancy Nye, Esq.</p>\n    <p id=\"b85-11\">MOTION TO SUPPRESS: Counsel for defendant contends that since no questions were asked the investigating officer concerning the absence of force or threats or promises of leniency or reward, the confession of the defendant must be suppressed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b85-13\">It is true that the prosecutor did not establish by questions of the investigating officer that no force or threats were directed at the defendant and that no promises of leniency or reward were made to him. Unquestionably, this would be the better practice. However, there was read to the grand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>jury the Miranda waiver (Exhibit 1) which states over the defendant's signature the following in pertinent part:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b86-3\">* * *</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b86-4\">\"No promises or threats have been made to me and no pressure or coercion of any kind has been used against me.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b86-5\">Signed Peter Quitugua\"</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b86-6\">No evidence was introduced by the defense that any force, violence, or threats were directed at the defendant or that any promises of leniency or reward were made to him. The Court holds that by a preponderance of the evidence the statement of defendant was voluntary. The testimony of the people's witness established beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was advised of his right to remain silent pursuant to the standards provided by the Supreme Court of the United States in Arizona v. Miranda and that defendant voluntarily waived such right to remain silent.</p>\n    <p id=\"b86-7\">MOTION TO DISMISS: Counsel for defendant next contends that even though the confession be admissible, the prosecution failed to establish by sufficient evidence that the corpus delicti was established, i. e., that the crime of burglary was committed. Using the \"reasonable cause\" standard provided by Section 50.54(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Court finds that it was.

Plaintiff appeared through counsel, Tom Perham. Defendant was represented by counsel, F. Randall Cunliffe. The Court, upon hearing the merits of both sides, reserved decision in this matter.</p>\n    <p id=\"b68-5\">Plaintiff contends that the repossession letter written by Bank of Hawaii to defendant, dated January 5, 1979, represented reasonable notice of the intended sale by Datsun Motors of the repossessed vehicle as required by UCC \u00a79-504(3). The letter states in pertinent part, \"... and after ten (10) days from the date of this letter, your contract will be reassigned back to the seller, who will handle the sale or disposition of the vehicle. ...\" (Exhibit \"A\"). Plaintiff concludes that on the basis of the above notice from Bank of Hawaii no genuine issue on the question of reasonable notice exists. This court does not agree.</p>\n    <p id=\"b68-6\">The affidavits submitted by the plaintiff are conclusive showing that the above referred to letter was in fact duly mailed and received by the defendant. The issue presented by the letter, however, is not the reasonableness of the delivery and receipt, but the adequacy of content of the notice. UCC \u00a79-504(3) requires, \"... notification of the time after which any private sale or other disposition is to be made . . . .\" Does the letter inform defendant of the time after which Datsun intended to sell the vehicle?

The thrust of Petitioner's argument is that she is domiciled on Guam and that the marital domicile was Guam. During the testimony in support of her petition, Petitioner Loan Kim Barker admitted that she had paid certain people the sum of $6,000 to kill the deceased, and fled Guam shortly after the murder. Petitioner further testified that she has been convicted of second degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>murder in this regard before the District Court of Guam. Petitioner also testified that she and Albert D. Barker were married in Vietnam \"in 1971\" and moved to Guam \"some time in 1973\". It must be remembered that this case is a petition for declaration of allegedly vested community property rights, not a petition to take under the estate of the deceased.</p>\n    <p id=\"b59-3\">Donna B. Lawrence, the personal representative the deceased within the State of Colorado, opposes this petition on several grounds: (1) that the marital domicile was Colorado and that Colorado law therefore governs this case as to personal property; (2) that personal property acquired by the decedent while residing in Guam, but domiciled in Colorado is not community property; and (3) that the marital domicile of the Barker's was Colorado, and by operation of law, a woman, upon marriage, loses her former domicile and acquires that of her husband, no matter where the wife actually lives, what she believes, of what she intends.</p>\n    <p id=\"b59-4\">FINDINGS OF FACT: From all the evidence in this case, this court finds the following facts:</p>\n    <p id=\"b59-6\">Petitioner and the deceased were married in Vietnam in 1971 and moved to Guam some time in 1973.</p>\n    <p id=\"b59-7\">This court takes judicial notice that in the case of Barker v. Barker, Domestic Case No. 752-78, the deceased declared Himself to be domiciled in Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b59-8\">Petitioner has never been to Colorado and never intended to make Colorado her home.</p>\n    <p id=\"b59-9\">The marital domicile, the situs of the marriage, was Guam, from the time of the Barker's arrival upon Guam until the deceased's death.</p>\n    <p id=\"b59-10\">Petitioner has been convicted before the District Court of Guam of the second degree murder of the deceased.</p>\n    <p id=\"b59-11\">Petitioner paid $6,000 in community property funds to certain persons to kill the deceased.</p>\n    <p id=\"b59-12\">Subsequent to the deceased's death, Petitioner expended $10,000 in what had been community property funds. These expenditures included the cost of transportation to flee Guam for the primary purpose of avoiding prosecution, living expenses, gifts, loans given to various people, $5,000 in attorneys' fees to defend Petitioner on the murder charge, and $3,000 which was put up as bail.</p>\n    <p id=\"b59-13\">Substantially all the expenses of running the family home, except for food, plus substantially all the expenses of the murder, the escape, and the attorneys' fees and bail have come from Petitioner's earnings as a waitress in various bars. At the time Petitioner earned this money she and the deceased were living together, under the same roof.</p>\n    <p id=\"b59-14\">The deceased caused all his salary from his employment with the Federal Aviation Administration to be deposited in a bank in Hawaii, under his name alone.</p>\n    <p id=\"b60-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>The court notes from the record in this case that the deceased had an extensive estate, including two mortgages, a substantial amount of cash, and many $100 savings bonds, all in his name alone.</p>\n    <p id=\"b60-3\">If any of the above findings of fact be deemed rulings of law, they are to be so considered.</p>\n    <p id=\"b60-4\">RULINGS OF LAW: Two statutes of Guam provide that a wife must live where her husband chooses. See Civil Code \u00a7103 and \u00a7156. However, \u00a7129 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b60-6\">\u00a7129. Residence, proof required. In actions for dissolution of marriage neither the domicile nor residence of the husband shall be deemed to be the domicile or residence of the wife. For the purpose of such an action each may have a separate domicile or residence depending upon proof of the fact and not upon legal presumptions. Physical presence in Guam for one (1) year next preceding the commencement of the actioii shall give rise to a presumption of residence required by \u00a7123 of this Code. TEmphasis added.]</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b60-8\">The above section speaks in terms of the possibility of separate domiciles of husband and wife for the purposes of a divorce action. Although this section is by no means a law of general applicability, it does indicate that a person may have different domiciles for different purposed. This is in accord with the modern view. Witkin and Proposed Official Draft of the Second Restatement of Conflict of Laws, \u00a711. It must also El-noted that \u00a7103 and \u00a7156 of the Code of Civil Procedure both speak in terms of \"place of living\", not domicile. Thus, a showing that the deceased was domiciled, for some purposes, in Colorado, does not preclude this court from finding that the marital domicile, the situs of the marriage, was Guam. This appears to be the only reasonable result in this case. This court takes judicial notice that in the case of Barker v. Barker, Domestic Case No. 752-78, the deceased declared himself to be domiciled in Guam. Under Civil Code \u00a7129, the deceased need not have done that as a declaration of Colorado as his domicile wouldn't have effected the Court's jurisdiction in that case. Further, there has been testimony in this case that Petitioner Loan Kim Barker has never been to Colorado, never agreed to move to Colorado, and felt that the climate there-would be too cold for her comfort. The court believes this testimony on these points. Based upon all of the above, the court finds that the marital domicile, the situs of the marriage, was Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b61-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The court must therefore proceed to determine the status of the property in question. The court has found, based upon Petitioner Loan Kim Barker's testimony that she and the deceased were married in VietnNam in 1971 and moved to Guam 'some time in 1973\". Accordingly, Petitioner asserts property in question acquired on and after the date of her marriage. Section 164 of the Civil Code supports this position. This section provides in part as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b61-3\">\u00a7164. Community property generally. All other property acquired after marriage by either husband of wife, or both, including real property situated in Guam, and personal property wherever situated, heretofore or hereafter acquired while domiciled elsewhere, which would not have been the separate property of either if acquired while domiciled in the Territory of Guam is community property; . . .</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b61-4\">Under this statute, all of the property in question which was acquired on or after the date of the Barker's marriage in Vietnam, but before their arrival in Guam, would be transformed into community property, if it were not already community property under the laws of Vietnam, upon their arrival and taking up of marital domicile on Guam. Such a view, however, overlooks the operation of those provisions of the Constitution of the United States made applicable to Guam by the Organic Act of Guam. 48 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71421 et seq. The Supreme Court of California has declared an identically worded statute unconstitutional as it applied to the devolution of property upon death. Estate of Thornton, 1 Cal. 2d 1, 33 P.2d 1 (1934). See also, Paley v. Bank of America, 159 Cal. App. 2d 500, 324 P.2d 35 (1958). Accordingly, and for the same reasons cited in Thorton, op. cit., \u00a7164 of the Civil Code is declared void pursuant to 48 U.S.C. \u00a71421b.(u) to the extent that \u00a7164 purports to apply to the devolution upon death of property acquired in a non-community property jurisdiction. See also. Estate of Nicolls, 164 Cal. 368, 129 P. 278 (1912). But see, Addison v. Addison, 62 Cal. 2d 558, 43 Cal. Rptr. 97, 399 P.2d 897 (1965).</p>\n    <p id=\"b61-5\">Therefore, only that property in question which was acquired after the Barker's arrival on Guam would be community property by virtue of Civil Code \u00a7164, but was it already community property by virtue of the laws of Vietnam? The law of Vietnam in this regard has been neither pleaded nor proved. Notwithstanding that there is a presumption that property acquired during a marriage is community property, under \u00a7164, it is still Petitioner's burden to establish the relevant time frame during which such a presumption would operate. That is to say, to plead and prove the law of Vietnam and/or also to prove on what date the Barker's arrived on Guam thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>moving the situs of their marriage to Guam. Petitioner has therefore failed in her proof as to the nature of that portion of the property in question that was acquired before the Barker's removal to Guam. Walton v. Arabian American Oil Co., 233 F.2d 541 (2nd Cir. 1956) cert. den. 352 U.S. 872 (1956).</p>\n    <p id=\"b62-3\">To apply the lex fori or to indulge the presumption that the law of Vietnam is the same as the law of Guam would also be inappropriate in this case. To do either could be correct if the law of Vietnam happened to be community property, but it would not be if the law of Vietnam were other than community property. Petitioner's case is silent on this point and this court will not risk attenuating constitutional rights when such a risk results from the failure of Petitioner, who has the burden of proof, to plead and prove the law of Vietnam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b62-4\">Similarly, Petitioner has established only that she and her husband came to Guam \"sometime in 1973\". Petitioner, having the burden of proof, may not take advantage of her own imprecision in her proof of facts. Therefore, the Petitioner's community property interest attached only to that portion of the property in question that was acquired on or after December 31, 1973.</p>\n    <p id=\"b62-5\">Petitioner admitted in her testimony that her husband's death was brought about by her hiring certain persons to kill him and that she ultimately left Guam shortly after her husband's murder. The court has found that the primary purpose of Petitioner\u2019s leaving Guam was to avoid prosecution for her husband's murder. (It must be remembered that this case is dealing with Petitioner's vested community property rights, and not with any inheritance.) It is argued by Petitioner that all such expenditures, including the murder, transportation costs, living expenses, gifts, and attorneys fees, were paid from Petitioner's separate property. There is presumption that all property acquired during marriage is community property. Civil Code \u00a7164. The burden is upon Petitioner to show that such property, which was clearly acquired during her marriage, is her separate property. Wilson v. Wilson, 76 Cal.App. 2d 119, 172 P.2d 568 (1946). This is frequently a very difficult burden to meet. Petitioner testified that the deceased never gave her any money to run the house and that all the expenses of running the house, the murder, escape, and attorney\u2019s fees came from her earnings as a waitress in various bars. Such testimony, coming from an admitted convicted felon with a strong interest in these proceedings might well be viewed with suspicion but for extensive corroboration of that testimony. Testimony was had from other witnesses that the deceased caused his pay to be deposited in a bank in Hawaii. The deceased also had an extensive estate, all in his own name, including two mortgages, a substantial amount of cash, and many $100 savings bonds. Considering the extraordinary lengths to which the deceased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>went to keep any of his earnings from going to the support of his family, Petitioner's testimony on this point is most credible indeed. Petitioner has clearly established that, except for trivial amounts, all the expenses of running the house and the expenses of the murder, transportation cost, living expenses, gifts, and attorney's fees were paid from money that Petitioner earned on Guam, during her marriage to the deceased, Any such trifling contributions from the deceased would not transform what would otherwise be separate property into community. Estate of Cudworth, 133 Cal. 462, 65 P. 1041 (1901).</p>\n    <p id=\"b63-3\">However, Petitioner has not established that such funds were her separate property, only that they came from her earnings. Civil Code \u00a7164 provides that such earnings are part of the community property. The fruits of such earnings would only be Petitioner's separate property if, at the time of such money was earned, Petitioner was living separate from the deceased. See, Civil Code \u00a7169. There has been no showing that this was the case. Indeed, all the evidence shows that Petitioner was living with her husband during this time.</p>\n    <p id=\"b63-4\">The court has found that Petitioner fled Guam after the death of her husband. Thus, the expenditures for transportation, living, gifts, and attorney's fees must be held to have come from Petitioner's one-half interest in the community.</p>\n    <p id=\"b63-5\">As to the expense of hiring killers to murder her husband, this was paid out while Petitioner's husband was alive. Such expenditure, however, was unlawful. It was an illegal contract, a squandering of community funds. No lawful valuable consideration was received, It certainly served no family purpose. Accordingly, Petitioner's half interest in the community property must bear the cost of hiring her husband's murderers.</p>\n    <p id=\"b63-6\">The court has found that the cost of procuring the deceased's death to be $6,000.00. The court has found the cost of Petitioner's fleeing Guam, plus other expenditures incurred after the deceased's death, to be $10,000.00. This amount includes transportation costs, and living expenses, gifts, and attorney's fees. As the living expenses were incurred, the gifts purchased, and attorney's fees expended after the deceased's death, they all must be charged to Petitioner's half interest in the community property, notwithstanding that these expenditures were not illegal, immoral, or unethical. If any of the above rulings of law be deemed findings of fact, they are to be so considered.</p>\n    <p id=\"b63-8\">ORDER: Accordingly, the court declares that Petitioner does have a lawful interest in the property in question, to the following extent:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b64-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>A half interest in all such named property that was acquired on or after December 31, 1973, but a total value of $16,100.00 to be deducted from such half interest.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b64-3\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Emerson, Civil Case #99-72. The District Court of Guam specifically held unconstitutional \u00a7537(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure basing its ruling on the lack of any sort of prior notice or hearing afforded the debtor before the issuance of an ex parte writ of attachment on the debtor's property. These fundamental considerations of due process were originally declared in Snaidach v. Family Finance Corp., 95 U.S. 337 (1969), and Randone v. The Appellate Department 5 Cal. 3d 536 (1971), which specifically held unconstitutional California's ex parte writ of attachment statute \u00a7537(1), after which Guam's statute was fashioned.

In each case, an individual has recovered a judgment against a corporation for the intentional act of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>employee of the corporation. The corporation now seeks indemnification of judgment by its insurer.</p>\n    <p id=\"b79-3\">The insurer defended by asserting that an intentional act of the insured is excluded from the coverage by the policy which states in each instance:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b79-4\">The company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damages to which this insurance applies caused by an occurrence.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b79-5\">In both policies the word \"occurrence\" is defined as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b79-6\">Occurrence means an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b79-7\">They further assert that to allow recovery by the insured would be against public policy, and lastly contend that the executive status of the assailant within the corporation precludes recovery even if available to employees.</p>\n    <p id=\"b79-8\">The Court finds that none of the three defensive positions outlined by the insurers relieves them of the obligation of payment to their insureds.</p>\n    <p id=\"b79-9\">The first contention regarding the coverage afforded by the policies is not in accord with the many cases cited by third-party plaintiffs in their first memorandum. The exact language of the policies at issue was construed and found to afford coverage in Baltzar v. Williams, 254 So.2d 470 (La. Adp. 1971).</p>\n    <p id=\"b79-10\">The additional cases cited by third-party plaintiff also illustrate that if an intentional tort is not directed or committed by the insured it is covered. Arenson v. National Automobile and Casualty Insurance Company, 45 Cal.2d 81 (1955).</p>\n    <p id=\"b79-11\">The Court rejects the argument against permitting indemnification of persons guilty of no wrongdoing for which they are being reimbursed - they simply have the misfortune to be legally responsible for the wrongdoing of another.</p>\n    <p id=\"b79-12\">Section 43401 of the Government Code of Guam [stating]</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b79-13\">An insured is not liable for a loss caused by the willful act of insured; but he is not exonerated by the negligence of the insured or of the insured's agents or others.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b80-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>is the same as \u00a7533 of the California Insurance Code. In Arenson v.

Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, 484 F.2d 1295 (1973) is clearly on point.

Defendant was represented by Daniel Del Priori, Esquire, and the People were represented by D. Paul Vernier, Assistant Attorney General. This decision is based on the pleadings before the Court, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>transcript of the trial, the Court's observations during the trial, the memorandum of points and authorities filed by counsel, and the oral arguments made at the hearing.</p>\n    <p id=\"b113-3\">The Court has weighed the evidence and has determined that it was sufficient to justify the verdict. \"While it is the exclusive province of the jury to find the facts, it is the duty of the trial court to see that this function is intelligently and justly performed, and in the exercise of its supervisory power over the verdict, the Court, on motion for a new trial, should consider the probative force of the evidence and satisfy itself that the evidence as a whole is sufficient to sustain the verdict. It has been stated that a defendant is entitled to two decisions on the evidence, one by the jury and the other by the Court on motion for new trial. This does not mean, however, that the Court should disregard the verdict or that it should decide what result it would have reached if the case had been tried without a jury, but instead that it should consider the proper weight to be accorded to the evidence and then decide whether or not in its opinion, there is sufficient credible evidence to support the verdict\" [Cites omitted] People v. Robarge (1953) 41 C2d 628, 633. The Court finds that the jury's verdict was not contrary to the evidence.</p>\n    <p id=\"b113-4\">Defendant's second contention is that the prosecution engaged in prejudicial conduct. The Court, after carefully reviewing the record, finds no conduct that would be grounds for a new trial. Defense counsel argues that the prosecution argued to the jury that defendant was guilty of practicing law without a license. The Court cannot find a reference to the defendant being guilty of this act. The prosecutor did argue that defendant was practicing law without a license, but he did not use the word \"guilty.\" The Court finds that an inference could be made from the facts presented to the jury that would support this conclusion as part of an argument to support a showing of deception. This was not prejudicial misconduct.</p>\n    <p id=\"b113-5\">\"The right of counsel to discuss the merits of case, both as to the law and facts, is very wide, and he has the right to state fully his views as to what the evidence shows, and as to the conclusions to be fairly drawn therefrom. The adverse party cannot complain if the reasoning be faulty and the deductions illogical, as such matters are ultimately for consideration of the jury. In the argument before the jury, any reasonable inference may be drawn from the evidence, and it is a matter within the discretion of the trial court to determine whether counsel stays within the permissible range of discussion.\" People v. Beivelman, (1968) 70 C.2d 60, 76-77.</p>\n    <p id=\"b114-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Defendant's argument as to the marital privilege is incorrect. The new Rules of Evidence have done away with the rule that neither spouse could testify for or against the other without the consent of both. Under the old rule it was improper to comment on defendant spouse's failure to testify,for the defendant could not compel his spouse to testify either for or against him. Under the new Rules of Evidence, a defendant's spouse has no privilege to prevent his spouse from testifying, and comment on her testifying against defendant husband does not, therefore, constitute comment on the exercise of a privilege that defendant has or on his failure to call a witness that he cannot compel to testify on his behalf. Since defendant's failure to call his spouse was a failure to call a material and important witness, his not doing so could be considered by the jury and commented upon by the prosecuting attorney.\" [Cites Omitted] People v. Coleman, (1969) 71 C2d 1159, 1167.</p>\n    <p id=\"b114-7\">As to defendant's argument that the prosecution committed error by using a suppressed prior statement for impeachment purpose, the Court ruled already during the trial that this use was proper under Harris v. New York, (1971) 401 US 222, 91 S.Ct. 643. The Court reaffirms that ruling here.</p>\n    <p id=\"b114-8\">Defense counsel's final argument is that the prosecution indulged in prejudicial misconduct through racially prejudiced remarks. The Court finds this allegation totally unfounded. The record shows that if anything, the prosecution was speaking against any racial prejudice being held against the victim because of his nationality. There was clearly no attack on any person based on racial or national backgrounds.</p>\n    <p id=\"b114-9\">For all of the above-stated reasons, the Court DENIES defendant's 'Motion for a New Trial.</p>\n    <p id=\"b114-10\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

However, the Court then telephonically advised the parties that it wished to hear further arguments the next day on October 26, 1979, at 9:30 a.m. This written opinion follows the second hearing.</p>\n    <p id=\"b148-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>A careful reading of the transcript discloses that there was no evidence before the Superior Court to support the revocation of the appellant's release on bail. This is not a case where the defendant \"willfully violated the conditions of his release\" (Section 40.65 of the Guam Criminal Procedure Code), or where \"an indictment or information has been filed charging the person with the commission of an offense while released in the pending action\" (Section 40.75 of the Guam Criminal Procedure Code).</p>\n    <p id=\"b148-3\">Unfortunately, there was some confusion at the October 25, 1975 hearing because it was only halfway through the proceedings that the Court was made to realize that the appellant had not been formally charged with the commission of another offense, i.e. by indictment or information, as required by the Code. Although the Government tried to argue that the Complaint filed against the accused was sufficient for the Superior Court to have revoked his bail, Section 1.17 of the Guam Criminal Procedure Code clearly states that an information may not be filed until there has been a preliminary examination and an order holding defendant to answer under Section 45.80.</p>\n    <p id=\"b148-4\">No indictment or information has been filed against the appellant, and there is nothing to show that any condition of release has been willfully violated by the defendant. While the Superior Court might have had the power to automatically revoke the defendant's release on bail if the above conditions had been satisfied, the record makes it clear that the Superior Court based its revocation on the mere fact that a complaint had been filed. No where in the Guam Criminal Procedure Code does the mere filing of a complaint empower the court to take such action, and the Superior Court must be charged with uniformly applying all section of the Guam Criminal Procedure Code.</p>\n    <p id=\"b148-5\">Also, it seems that appellant's counsel was not given adequate notice and time to prepare for a hearing on the revocation of his client's bail. Certainly, minimum standards of due process require at least a few hours notice so that counsel may intelligently protect his client's rights. Here none of the conditions enumerated in Sections 40.65, 40.70 and 40.75 of the Guam Criminal Procedure Code were present; thus the better course would have been for the Government to prepare an Order to Show Cause with timely notice of hearing, so that a complete and effective record could be prepared. The case number of the subsequent complaint filed against the defendant was not even made part of the record during the Superior Court hearing.</p>\n    <p id=\"b148-6\">The October 24, 1975 revocation of defendant\u2019s release on bail is reversed, and the defendant is ordered released on the same conditions as previously existed, with the additional condition that he stay at his parents' house and observe a curfew between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.</p>\n    <p id=\"b149-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>SO ORDERED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b149-3\">Dated this 26th day of October, 1979.</p>\n    <p id=\"b149-4\">Footnote:</p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n      <p id=\"b149-5\">.

(Judgment filed September 22, 1978). Several issues are presented on appeal, some of which when taken alone would require reversal with an order for a new trial. However, at least one of the errors complained of by defendant is so basic to a right to. a fair trial that this Court, in reversing the conviction below, orders that the indictment be dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n    <p id=\"b203-12\">Defendant was indicted on March 8, 1978 and after a series of pretrial motions, trial was finally set for July 28, 1978. However, when defendant and her counsel appeared on this date, she was told that an order had been entered by the trial court on July 24, 1978 to continue proceedings until August 11, 1978. When defendant formally objected to the unexplained delay, trial was rescheduled to commence on August 1, 1978.</p>\n    <p id=\"b204-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>However, this matter was continued once again on the Court's own motion for August 8, 1978, even though the transcript clearly indicates that there was a Superior Court Judge ready and able to hear the case on short notice. Finally, trial was continued once more, based on a long distance telephone call by the Presiding Judge of the Superior Court stating that he desired to handle the case himself and that trial should be delayed indefinitely pending completion of a murder trial scheduled for the following week.</p>\n    <p id=\"b204-3\">Trial was finally commenced before the presiding judge on August 28, 1978. This was a month after trial was originally scheduled to proceed and after the defendant has moved unsuccessfully to have the presiding judge disqualified for bias. On the morning of trial, the government filed a document titled \"Supplemental Discovery\" which stated that several tape recordings of the defendant's conversations had been discovered to have been made, and that certain of these tapes had been lost.</p>\n    <p id=\"b204-4\">The trial judge refused to allow introduction of the tapes in the case in chief, because there was no mention of any tapes in the government's previous answer to discovery relatihg to electronic surveillance. However, the tapes were subsequently admitted to rebut the defendant's statements on the stand that she had not been involved in any heroin transaction. Defendant's request for a one-week continuance to study the tapes was denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b204-5\">At the outset we are confronted by the fact that due to the government's negligence, the accused was severely hampered in the preparation of her defense. There can be no question that when the prosecutor's office failed to file a timely response to defendant's^ request for discovery, the accused was put at a distinct disadvantage in being required to proceed with the tape recordings dangling like a sword over her head as rebuttal evidence. However, even more basic to this appeal is whether the loss of the tape recordings requires dismissal of the indictment. As stated in United States v. Bryant, 448 F.2d 1182, 1184, \"all discoverable evidence must be preserved; and tapes are no less discoverable. . . because they are of poor quality. It is the defendant's right to discover such evidence and decide for himself its usefulness.\"</p>\n    <p id=\"b204-6\">We have an instance here where a government agent surreptitiously recorded certain crucial conversations, following no established police procedure and then unilaterally deciding that they were of no probative value. The record is unclear whether the tapes were lost or destroyed, but the end result to the defendant was the same: she was unable to use a possible exculpatory piece of evidence due to the government's clear negligence in investigating and preparing a case. Based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Bryant, supra, dismissal of the indictment must result, Where, as here, there is no showing of excusable neglect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n    <p id=\"b205-3\">We are also very concerned by the fact that defendant's trial was delayed for a period of over four weeks because the Presiding Judge of the Superior Court desired to hear .the case personally, even though there was at least one other Superior Court judge available at the original trial date. In addition to the right to a speedy trial guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, Section 1.11 of the Guam Criminal Procedure Code [8 GCA] states that defendant is entitled \"to a speedy and public trial.\" Although, it is within the discretion of the Superior Court to prepare its trial calendar, a defendant's right to a speedy trial should not be unreasonably delayed to accommodate an individual judge's schedule.</p>\n    <p id=\"b205-4\">Closely related to the issue of unwarranted continuances of defendant's trial date is the question of whether or not the presiding judge should have disqualified himself from trying defendant's case. While the presiding judge arguably showed an abnormal interest in defendant's case in ordering the continuances, (and seemed to take the disqualification motion as a personal affront)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, the affidavit filed in support of disqualification fails to set forth a clear case of specific bias against the particular defendant, Mrs. Okada.</p>\n    <p id=\"b205-5\">This is not to suggest that we condone the action taken, which plainly and effectively destroyed the defendant's right to a speedy trial. If the indictment were not already ordered dismissed on the ground of government neglect in gathering evidence, we would be seriously pressed to consider whether or not dismissal of the indictment on speedy trial grounds would be appropriate. Also, it would seem that reversal of defendant's conviction alone would not be an effective sanction, because granting of a new trial would only result in defendant's being subjected to trial at a much later date than originally scheduled. The right to a speedy trial is not to be taken lightly; regardless of past scheduling practices in the Superior Court, a defendant's trial date should not be unreasonably delayed so that an individual judge may be present at trial.</p>\n    <p id=\"b205-7\">The remaining issues as to ineffectiveness of counsel and the court's refusal to allow the off-island deposition of an unavailable witness for the defense are rendered moot by the analysis above, as is the question of certain allegedly improper matters considered at sentencing.</p>\n    <p id=\"b205-8\">Concomitant with the reversal of defendant's conviction, it is hereby ordered that the indictment be dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n    <p id=\"b206-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>SO ORDERED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b206-3\">Footnotes:</p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n      <p id=\"b206-4\">. It is true that the Court in Bryant finally affirmed the conviction involving a lost tape, but only after it had balanced several factors involving the actual unintelligibility of the tape in question and the strong evidence of guilt adduced at trial. However, here, we do not have such strong factors to balance against the apparent negligence of the government. The record is not entirely clear as to what extent the tapes were intelligible, and the only real evidence against the defendant were the statements made by the agent who made the tape recordings. Also the negligence present in the instant appeal was considerably more egregious that present in Bryant, where there was at least a good faith effort to follow certain formalized procedures in collecting evidence.</p>\n    </footnote>\n    <footnote label=\"2\">\n      <p id=\"b206-5\">.

The Court finds his liability extended only to the period of time he was employed as a broker for Pacific Realty Company. He admits that he personally applied for the telephone on the company's behalf and he asserts that he cancelled the phone when leaving two months later. Although plaintiff has no record of the cancellation the testimony received indicates that a record of the cancellation might not have been made or if made, might have been destroyed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b35-12\">The Court finds Mr. Cate could be held liable only for the April and May billings and the installation charge. These billings as shown are $25.18 and the installation charge is $35.00.</p>\n    <p id=\"b36-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>However, testimony of the Telephone Company representative was that the bill payments from April to September were current.</p>\n    <p id=\"b36-3\">It therefore appears that Mr. Cate would not be liable for any of the present judgment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b36-4\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

First, a brief rendition of the facts will be necessary to put these disputes in their proper sequence.</p>\n    <p id=\"b210-12\">FACTS RELATING TO APPEAL #122A (Super.Ct. #1389-75)</p>\n    <p id=\"AFt\">During 1972, representatives of the teachers union and the school board negotiated a collective bargaining agreement entitled \"Three Year Agreement Between the Territorial Board of Education and the Guam Federation of Teachers, Local No. 1581, AFT.\" After this agreement was executed by the representatives, it was ratified by the Board of Education and approved by the Governor of Guam on October 3, 1972. Certain provisions in the agreement limited class sizes and teaching assignments. A provision also stated that the agreement was to remain in effect until June 13, 1975 and would then remain in effect indefinitely if new negotiations had been entered into by the parties in 1975 and a new contract had not been ratified.</p>\n    <p id=\"b210-13\">During the summer of 1975, after the negotiations had begun, P.L. 13-37 was enacted with certain provisions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>conflict with the collective bargaining agreement dealing with class sizes and teaching assignments. On August 21, 1975, the Governor of Guam issued Executive Order No. 75-38 reaffirming the authority of the Board of Education as a policy making body and stating that it should use its best judgment in supervising the public school system.</p>\n    <p id=\"b211-3\">In response to these new provisions increasing class sizes, certain teachers refused to accept additional students into their classes. The Superior Court found that the collective bargaining agreement was a valid contract and was to remain in effect until a new contract was ratified. The Court also ruled that the acts of the teachers' union [not] to accept additional students was not a strike as set forth in Section 4376 of the Government Code of Guam. Finally, the Court declared that P.L. 13-37:39 was void as an impairment of contract under \u00a729(b) and \u00a75(j) of the Organic Act of Guam and that Executive Order 75-38 did not abrogate the terms of the Three Year Collective Bargaining Agreement. (Decisions dated September 5, 1975 and September 15, 1975).</p>\n    <p id=\"b211-4\">FACTS RELATING TO APPEAL #125A (Super.Ct. #1816-75)</p>\n    <p id=\"b211-5\">On November 18, 1975, the Governor of Guam declared a financial emergency in the public school system and issued Executive Order No. 75-45 which suspended certain provisions of an October 1, 1972 collective bargaining agreement between the Territorial Board of Education and the Guam Federation of Teachers. More specifically, the Executive Order directed the education board and the teacher staff to increase class sizes and restrict preparation periods to one per day. After this order was released, the Guam Federation of Teachers obtained a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of this Order. In addition, the Superior Court issued a mandatory injunction requiring the Board of Education to comply with all aspects of the 1972 collective bargaining agreement. (see Preliminary Injunction, dated December 23, 1975).</p>\n    <p id=\"b211-6\">FINDING OF FACTS AND LAW</p>\n    <p id=\"Alv\">The parties seem to view these disputes as mainly centering on an impairment of contracts issue. It is argued by the teachers' union that the 1972 collective bargaining agreement is still in force and any efforts by the Governor, the education board, or the legislature to change these terms is a violation of Section 5(j) of the Organic Act, 48 USC 1421b(j) which deals with impairment of contracts. The government responds that the 1972 agreement is invalid as an illegal delegation of governmental authority to supervise the schools and therefore that the 1975 executive order should not have been enjoined. Further, the government urges on appeal that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>the activities of the teachers' union in allegedly refusing to accept additional students was a strike in violation of Section 4376 of the Government Code of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b212-3\">I.</p>\n    <p id=\"b212-4\">We agree with the Superior Court that in some instances a collective bargaining agreement should bind the government (barring some governmental emergency which makes its provisions unreasonable to follow). However, the provision in the collective bargaining agreement which states that the agreement shall remain in effect indefinitely until (and if) a new contract is ratified must be stricken as an illegal delegation of power. Supervision and control of the territorial departments (including the Board of Education) clearly rests with the Governor of Guam. 48 USC 1422 (amended in 1968 by Public Law 9-497). If these supervisory powers could be forever suspended by a 1972 collective bargaining agreement, flexibility and responsiveness in the administration of the school system would be effectively destroyed; unless the Guam Federation of Teachers gave its approval, the government would be unable to introduce any inconsistent provision into the law no matter how much it was needed to effectively deal with problems of the school district.</p>\n    <p id=\"b212-5\">The Superior Court's mandatory injunction sanctioned this illegal delegation of powers from the government to the teacher's union when it ignored Section 4411 of the Government Code (stating that \"[gjovernment management officials shall retain the right and responsibility, in accordance with applicable law and regulations to ... (d) determine the methods, organization, and assignment of personnel for the conduct of operations, including necessary actions in emergency situations\"). Cf. Jefferson Elementary School District v. Bent, 116 Cal. Rptr. 554 (1974) and Grasko v. Los Angeles Board of Education, 31 Cal. App.3d 290, 107 Cal. Rptr. 334 (1973).</p>\n    <p id=\"b212-7\">Although supervision of education systems differs between California and Guam, the above cited California cases are instructive when they state that the board of education of a district cannot contract away its responsibility to determine policy and conditions within the schools. Here, as in Jefferson Elementary School District and Grasko we have a situation where:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b212-8\">\"Various provisions of the Education Code [here the Organic Act of Guam and the Government Code] mandate that the governing board of [the] school district establish and administer rules and regulations with regard to the duties of teachers, the organization of the schools, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>the administration of educational policy. The agreement in the instant case prohibits the Board from unilaterally exercising its judgment and discretion in just such matters, e.g., teaching hours, class sizes, [etc.]. In this context, it makes no difference whether the agreement was a binding contract or merely proposals for adoption by the Board. The Board exceeded its authority by either ratifying a contract or adopting resolutions which required it to get prior written approval [here a newly ratified agreement] from the [teacher's union] before making changes in the terms of the contract, agreement or regulations.\" (Jefferson Elementary School District, 116 Cal. Rptr. at 559).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b213-3\">To give the agreement full effect after June 13, 1975 when the contract was scheduled to expire would be unreasonable for it would usurp the power of the government to supervise the schools. In effect, the Superior Court's ruling has transferred over to the teachers' union this power for an indefinite period of time. Presumably, the agreement would still be valid and binding even into the next century unless the teachers were willing to ratify a new contract.</p>\n    <p id=\"b213-4\">Finally, in D.C. Appeal #125A (Super.Ct. #1816-75) the Superior Court totally ignored uncontradicted evidence that there was a financial emergency within the school system where there were insufficient funds to pay enough teachers to satisfy the 1972 agreement regarding class size and preparation periods. (RT 22-36, 36 to 48). Even had the contract been valid and binding after it was due to expire, the Superior Court seems to have totally discounted this testimony without stating its reasons for finding that there was no emergency to justify an alteration of the agreement. (See Rules 65(d) of the Rules of Civil Procedure for the Superior Court of Guam).</p>\n    <p id=\"b213-5\">II.</p>\n    <p id=\"b213-6\">The Superior Court also committed error in ruling that the actions of the teachers' union in turning away students did not constitute a strike in violation of \u00a74376 of the Government Code. It is irrelevant whether the teachers' union was \"insulated by the collective bargaining agreement,\" or \"whether the chaotic condition . . . was generated by administrative guidelines and legislative intervention,\" (as the September 15, 1975 decision seems to be based on at page 4). Even if the collective bargaining agreement somehow had been in effect in September of 1975, the validity of such an agreement cannot be used as a mantle to excuse the teachers' actions which clearly resulted in a slowdown and retardation of work in violation of the orders promulgated by the Director of Education.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Board of Education v. New Jersey Education Association, 53 N.J. 29, 247 A.2d 867, 871-872, (1968). Cf. 37 A.L.R.3d 1150 and 48 Am.Jur.2d 1361. It is also argued that the retardation of work was not a \"concerted action\" and therefore not really a strike. Uncontradicted testimony shows that the President of the teachers' union advised teachers to honor only the class ratios under the terms of the 1972 agreement, regardless of instructions to the contrary by the Director of Education. (Appeal #122A [Super.Ct. #1389-75] RT 103-107; Exhibits 2 and 3). Also six principals or vice principals testified at length as to the disruption throughout the school system. (RT 16, 42, 61, 69, 84, 92).</p>\n    <p id=\"b214-3\">III.</p>\n    <p id=\"b214-4\">Finally, we do not agree with the appellees that these cases have become moot for it is clear that the injunction in question still has continuing effect on negotiations between the union and the government. See Grasko, supra, 107 Cal. Rptr. at 340-341. Both Parties suggest that the court should take judicial notice of certain additional facts not contained in the record. However, these facts would have no affect on our finding that to give the perpetuity provision of the 1972 agreement valid effect would result in an illegal delegation of the government's authority to supervise and control the school system.</p>\n    <p id=\"b214-5\">Based on the above, we find that the 1972 collective bargaining agreement between the teachers' union and the Government of Guam is no longer valid and binding and that the Superior Court erred in ordering a mandatory injunction requiring the Board of Education to comply with all aspects of the 1972 Agreement, despite Executive Order No. 75-45. we find also that the Superior Court erred in finding that the activities of the teachers' union did not constitute a strike in violation of Section 4376 of the Government Code.</p>\n    <p id=\"b214-6\">It is ordered that the denial of the temporary restraining order in Civil Case No. 1389-75 (D.C. Appeal #122A) be reversed and that the cause be remanded to the Superior Court for action consistent with this opinion. It is also ordered that the mandatory injunction issued in Civil Case No. 1816-75 (D.C. Appeal #125A) be dissolved.</p>\n    <p id=\"b214-7\">REVERSED</p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n      <p id=\"b214-8\">The union has suggested that Public Law 75-38 represents an illegal attempt by the Legislature to supervise and control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>the school system because the Organic Act of Guam clearly vests such power in the Governor. 48 USC 1422. However, it seems clear that the actions of the teachers' union were in direct violation of orders promulgated by the Department of Education (regardless of whether these acts were also in violation of the Public Law). Also, the union does not attempt to explain how the Department of Education should be expected to honor the 1972 collective bargaining agreement when the legislature failed to appropriate the funds with which to hire sufficient teachers to keep class sizes below the prescribed maximum.</p>\n    </footnote>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Barrie Michelsen.</p>\n    <p id=\"b73-5\">The Court received testimony and oral arguments from both parties.

The Court fears, however, that this procedure would not necessarily solve defendant's problem. Within the federal case law there are decisions where the appellate court did not accept a notice of appeal that resulted from procedural correction of a clerical error by the method being attempted herein.

Ct. 1019, 1023) in waiving his right to silence and an attorney.</p>\n    <p id=\"b119-12\">There are no allegations of coercion regarding the situation at the defendant's home, and thus the Court finds that the Territory has in the totality of the circumstances met its burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the statement was freely and voluntarily given. (Lego v. Twomey, 404 U.S. 477, 92 S. Ct. 619 (1972). The statement at the residence will therefore not be suppressed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b120-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>II. ORAL AND WRITTEN STATEMENTS AT THE POLICE STATION.</p>\n    <p id=\"b120-3\">Following the statement at the defendant's residence, there was a break in the interrogation. The defendant was again interrogated upon arriving at Police Headquarters. It is undisputed that the defendant was given and understood his \"Miranda\" rights. He initialed each of his rights to show that he understood them. <em>However, he </em>refused to sign the waiver of rights form.</p>\n    <p id=\"b120-5\">The fact that a defendant refuses to sign a waiver of rights form is not dispositive of the question of waiver of the right to counsel and to remain silent (U.S. v. McDaniel, 462 F2d 129, 135, 5th Cir. 1972, U.S. v. Phelps, 443 F2d 246, 248, 5th Cir. 1971), for despite refusal to sign a waiver form a defendant may volunteer a statement without having been questioned further by the authorities (U.S. v. Hopkins, 5th Cir. 1970, 433 F2d 1041, 1044).</p>\n    <p id=\"b120-6\">The Fifth Circuit framed the issue before this Court in U.S. v. Phelps, supra.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b120-7\">It is clear that after Phelps refused to sign the waiver, the officers should have ceased interrogating him. It is also clear that subsequent conversation did occur between the investigators and Phelps. The hearing on the motion to suppress does not reveal, however, whether the subsequent questions by the officers were the result of voluntary conversation initiated by Phelps or whether these questions were initiated by the officers themselves without any instigation by Phelps. If the former situation obtains, then under our decision in Hopkins, Phelps' subsequent answers would be admissible. If the latter situation obtain, however, Miranda compels that we hold answers inadmissible. (443 F2d 249, 250)</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b120-8\">This language gives effect to the rules laid down by Miranda v. Arizona, 1966, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602. First, \"If the individual indicated in any manner at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes remain silent, the interrogation must cease. At this point he has shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege; and statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise.\" 384 U.S. 373 , 86 S. Ct. 1627.</p>\n    <p id=\"b120-9\">Second, \"If the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.....If the interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on the Government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>against self-incrimination and his right to retain appointed counsel.\" 384 U.S. 474-75, 86 S. Ct. 1628.</p>\n    <p id=\"b121-3\">In the instant case the Government has not met its \"heavy burden\" of showing knowing and intelligent waiver. Defendant refused to sign a statement which said \"I am willing to make a statement and answer questions. I do not want a lawyer at this time.\" This refusal came at 7:00 p.m. It is undisputed that defendant's subsequent statement was the result of questions propounded by officers, and was signed four to five hours after the refusal to sign the waiver form.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b121-4\">[A] valid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused after warnings are given or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact finally obtained...</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b121-5\">Whatever the testimony of the authorities as to waiver of rights by an accused, the fact of lengthy interrogation or incommunicado incarceration before a statement is made is strong evidence that the accused did not validly waive the right and that the individual eventually made a statement is consistent with the conclusion that the compelling influence of the interrogation finally forced him to do so. It is inconsistent with any motion of a voluntary relinquishment of the privilege. Miranda, supra, 384 U.S. 475-76 86 S. Ct. 1628.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b121-6\">On the facts of this case it is the conclusion of the Court that the Government has met its burden of showing that the defendant was advised of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, but that the Government has not met the burden of showing that there was a knowing and intelligent waiver of such rights. Consequently, all oral and written statements made at police headquarters on February 27 and 28, 1979 must be suppressed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b121-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The parties appeared by counsel.</p>\n    <p id=\"b17-11\">Plaintiff Securities Administrator (\"SA\") has alleged in its complaint that defendant Pacific Memorial Plan, Inc., (\"PMP\") is selling investment contracts that require regulation as securities under Title XLI of the Guam Government Code. This court finds that the pre-need agreements at issue here are not investment contracts, and, therefore, are not subject to regulation as securities.</p>\n    <p id=\"b17-12\">Defendant PMP is in the business of selling \"pre-need\" funeral arrangements. The purchaser selects a certain funeral arrangement for use either by himself or herself when he or she dies, or by an assignee of the purchaser when that individual dies. There is no monetary return on the purchase price; only the providing of an agreed upon service.</p>\n    <p id=\"b17-13\">The parties argue whether or not the contracts fell within the criteria of investment contract found in Securities and Exchange Commission v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946). The\"Supreme Court lists three criteria: (1) investment of money, (2) a common enterprise, and (3) profits derived solely from the promoter's efforts. Thus, the Howey test focuses on the concepts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>investor participation and expectation of profits. The court finds that the pre-need agreements do not meet this test.</p>\n    <p id=\"b18-3\">Both parties cited United Housing Foundation, Inc., v. Foreman, 421 U.S. 837, 95 S.Ct. 2051, 44 L.Ed.2d 589 (1975). The Supreme Court's language is applicable here. The court said:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b18-4\">By profits, the Court has meant either capital appreciation resulting from the development from the initial investment, . . . or a participation in earnings resulting from the use of investor's funds. ... In such cases the investor is \"attracted solely by the prospects of a return\" on his investment. By contract, when a purchaser is motivitated by desire to use or consume the item purchased . . . the securities laws do not apply. (emphasis added) 421 U.S. at 852-853.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b18-6\">The court finds that the evidence does not support any conclusion other than the persons buying the pre-need agreements are planning to use them for their own use, and not for resale. Because the language of the contract only allows for a return of sixty-five percent (65%) of the paid price if the agreement is cashed in for some reason, the court finds that the pre-need agreement could not be a profitable investment for the purchaser as required under the Howey test.</p>\n    <p id=\"b18-7\">Plaintiff's basis for asserting that a profit return exists is that by purchasing the service now, the purchaser is certain to save money. Money saved is not a profit. A profit is the gain realized from business or investment over and above expenditures. Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Edition, West. No such profit is found in the pre-need agreement. If the purchaser buys the funeral service today and uses it in ten (10) years, he has not made a profit. He has simply saved his family, friends or society the increase in price they may have had to pay for his burial at the time of death. It is, in fact, conceivable that inflation may be stopped somehow, and prices fall. The purchaser is simply buying a service, and putting off delivery until some later date.</p>\n    <p id=\"b18-8\">As the California Supreme Court found in People v. Davenport, 13 Cal.2d 681, 91 P.2d 892 (1939), the mere expectation of the payment of interest upon money has been held not to transform a transaction into an \"investment contract\" within the meaning of the corporate securities act. This is more than the expectation offered by the defendant.. The plan will not return even interest to the purchaser. All it will do is pay for a service at a set price. This is not a return on an investment, but is simply a delivery of a purchased service.</p>\n    <p id=\"b18-9\">In State v. Lorentz, 221 Minn. 366, 22 NW2d 313 (163 ALR 1036) (1946), the court found that the sale of cemetery lots was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>a security. In that case, unlike the case at bar, the lots were being sold in groups for resale at a profit. There was a common venture that led to a return on the investment. In dicta, the court stated that the purchase of individual lots by persons planning to use them for family members would not be a security subject to regulation.</p>\n    <p id=\"b19-3\">When the purchaser enters the pre-need agreement, he can take delivery at any time. It could be tomorrow or in twenty years. Whenever he takes delivery, he gets the same service. It is possible PMP may have problems fulfillng its contractual agreement, and regulation of PMP may be desirable. But the contracts are not investment contracts that are subject to regulation under the securities act. A number of cases involving \"pre-need\" burial services are annotated in Vol. 22, Am Jur2d, Dead Bodies, Section 3, and 68 ALR2d 1251.</p>\n    <p id=\"b19-4\">It is, therefore, ordered that the motion be, and it hereby is, granted.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The defendant interposed as a defense to the granting of such a motion that \u00a7139 of the Civil Code which provides for the payment of child support by fathers, but not by mothers, is a violation of equal protection of the law on the basis of sex.</p>\n    <p id=\"b134-5\">There can be little doubt that Civil Code \u00a7139 is exactly the sort of law condemned as a violation of the equal protection of the laws by Orr v. Orr 99 S.Ct. 1102 (1979). However, this is not dispositive of the question before the court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b134-6\">First, Civil Code \u00a7138 provides a basis for the award of child support which is not sex based. Thus, even if \u00a7139 were found to be void as urged, there is a basis for the award of child support.</p>\n    <p id=\"b134-7\">Second, although this statute as written is violative of the Constitution, and by authority of Orr v. Orr void, this court need not reach this result, or indeed a federal constitutional issue, in this case. The Fourteenth Guam Legislature enacted P.L. 14-28(b), which provides \"Equality of Rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex. All laws, rules, regulations, and Executive Orders with the force of law which are inconsistent with this section are hereby repealed to the extent of such \u25a0 inconsistency.\" Thus, before reaching any federal constitutional issue, this Court must first decide the effect under Guam law of these two statutes when read together. And as P.L. 14-28(b) speaks to repeal to the extent of inconsistency, not the voiding of statutes which are violative of equal protection, it is the court's task to determine whether Civil Code \u00a7139 must be held repealed in whole or in part.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b134-8\">Where a statute denies equal protection by making an unconstitutional classification, the classification can be abolished by making the statute operate either on everyone or on no one ..... Though the test is imprecise, a court must weigh the general interest in retaining the statute against the court's reluctance to extend legislation to those not previously covered. Such an inquiry may lead a court into examination of legislative purpose, the overall statutory scheme, statutory arrangements in connected fields and the needs of the public. Developments in the Law-Equal Protection, 82 Harv. L.Rev. 1065, 1136-37 (1979) (footnote omitted), as quoted in Commonwealth v. Butler 328 A.2d 851, 860 (Pa. 1974).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b135-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>The overall Guam statutory scheme in the area of divorce is built around the concept of child support, and in the more than 25 years since the enactment of \u00a7139, the people of Guam have adjusted their affairs in reliance that this concept exists.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b135-3\">\"When a statute, either alone or in conjunction with another statute or statutes, infringes on constitutional rights, this court has an obligation to make every effort to salvage the statute by an appropriate exclusion so long as legislative intent will not be frustrated thereby.\" Commonwealth v. Butler 328 A.2d 851, 860 (Pa. 1974).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b135-4\">This is especially true, when as here, we have a governing statute which speaks in terms of repeal \"to the extent of such inconsistency.\" Accordingly, it is the ruling of this court that all references to \"husband\", \"wife\", \"him\", and \"her\" in the Civil Code \u00a7139 are repealed, and that this statute should be read with the non-sex-based term \"a party\" wherever such terms are used.</p>\n    <p id=\"b135-5\">Plaintiff's motion for an Order to show Cause is GRANTED, and Plaintiff's attorney is to make a motion for a hearing date.</p>\n    <p id=\"b135-6\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Plaintiffs were represented by Timothy Stewart. Defendant Lopez was represented by Ladd Baumann and defendant Tengan was represented by Harry Boertzel.</p>\n    <p id=\"b94-6\">Defendants Lopez and Tengan have moved to be dismissed from this action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(g). Their motions are more properly treated as Rule 56 summary judgment motions as each has submitted an affidavit in support of the motion.</p>\n    <p id=\"b94-7\">The basis of each of these motions is identical: that the individual defendants are not within the jurisdiction of the Court by operation of the Government Claims Act, Government Code \u00a76500 et. seq.. Defendants base this reading of the Government Claims Act on dicta from a Superior Court Decision in Manibusan v. Guam Memorial Hospital, Civil Case No 285-78. This decision dated 2 November 1978 held that the Government Claims Act did not apply to Guam Memorial Hospital, but also suggested that the Act \"makes Claims Act procedures applicable to suits against individual Government Health Professionals and inapplicable in suits against Guam Memorial Hospital itself.\"</p>\n    <p id=\"b94-8\">The decision in Manibusan was a result of an analysis of Public 14-29, the \"Guam Memorial Hospital Act\", and especially an analysis of the legislative history and intent of Public Law 14-29. A plain reading of the Hospital Act does not result in the Government Claims Act being applicable to Hospital employees while inapplicable to claims against the Hospital itself, and there is no indication in the legislative history that this result was intended. To the contrary, the legislative history reflects the concern and intent that the Government of Guam not be liable for the actions of Hospital employees and agents.</p>\n    <p id=\"b94-9\">The result urged by defendant is an odd one for the liability which the Hospital has under Manibusan largely flows from the acts of its employees and agents. It would be an absurd result if a plaintiff were allowed to proceed via the Claims Act against Government of Guam and against an autonomous instrumentality of the Government of Guam, the Hospital, for the same negligent acts of the same employee. There is no indication the legislature intended such double recovery.</p>\n    <p id=\"b94-10\">A second ground exists for denial of defendants' motions. Even if the Claims Act were applicable to the defendants, it does not result in a dismissal as urged by the defendants. Thus it is not necessary to decide if \u00a76500.13(e) and (b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>provide an independent basis of Government liability for \"health care professionals\" from that of being an agent or employee of the hospital. The Government Claims Act does not immunize or indemnify Government employees, rather it waives the sovereign immunity of the Government of Guam on certain terms. It provides that a plaintiff may have judgment or settlement against either the individual or the Government, but not both (except in certain situations set forth in \u00a76500.20, see Paulin v. Government of Guam, Superior Court Civil Case No. 842-78, Decision of February 11, 1980.)</p>\n    <p id=\"b95-3\">Thus, the lack of a filing with the Attorney General as shown by defendants' affidavits does not immunize these defendants. If the Claims Act did apply, then in the absence of a claim there could be no settlement or judgment against the Government and thus no bar to this action against the individual.</p>\n    <p id=\"b95-4\">The motion is denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b95-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

She did not consent, as she had indicated prior to birth, to the child\u2019s availability for adoption and the child was placed in a foster home under the custody of Social Services. Later the infant was returned to the Juvenile Justice premises where the mother was confined, in hopes of inspiring motherly affection and care.</p>\n    <p id=\"b291-3\">On March 8,1974, while the child was at Juvenile Justice, Mr. and Mrs. Barda, with counsel, appeared before Judge Perez and attested to all matters necessary to show qualification as adoptive parents. They then left the Island and returned to the mainland.</p>\n    <p id=\"b291-4\">On March 11, 1974, the child was put in the foster home of Mr. and Mrs. Gumataotao where she has remained until this date.</p>\n    <p id=\"b291-5\">On July 29,1974, the Attorney General, upon recommendation of Public Health and Social Services and Probation workers, filed a petition for Termination of Parental Rights versus the mother. After numerous continuances caused by the failure of the mother to appear after one notice, the hearing was held without the mother present. The petition was granted on October 22, 1974. Social Services informed the Gumataotaos the child was now adoptable and they filed their petition on October 31, 1974.</p>\n    <p id=\"b291-6\">The Court has heard the testimony of the parties herein except for Mrs. Barda, and has satisfied itself that both couples are fully qualified, indeed outstandingly so, as adoptive parents.</p>\n    <p id=\"b291-7\">The testimony has further shown that no rights vested in the Bardas prior to this time because of the appearance before Judge Perez on March 8, 1974. Thus, each petition is to be considered without regard to date of filing.</p>\n    <p id=\"b291-8\">The issue to be resolved then, is which of the family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>situations will best enhance the life of Baby Jennifer, which is in the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n    <p id=\"b292-3\">The negative factors in the child\u2019s staying with the Gumataotaos which the Court has weighed, are the age of the petitioners and the fact that although parental rights are terminated, the child\u2019s natural mother knows where the child is placed and is of an unstable nature.</p>\n    <p id=\"b292-4\">This means, as pointed out by counsel, Mr. Gumataotao will be seventy (70) when Jennifer is seventeen (17) and Mrs. Gumataotao will be sixty-eight (68), as opposed to the projected ages of fifty-nine (59) and fifty-one (51) for the Bardas.</p>\n    <p id=\"b292-5\">It also means that it is conceivable that Jennifer\u2019s natural mother could be a disruptive influence in the child\u2019s life, something quite unlikely if the child were on the mainland with the Bardas.</p>\n    <p id=\"b292-6\">The age factor does not disturb this Court inasmuch as the Gumataotaos appear vigorous active persons. In any event, the raising of young children into responsible adulthood by grandparents is common enough to the culture of this Island as not to indicate that even so pronounced an age difference will mar Jennifer\u2019s development. The possibility of Mr. Gumataotao\u2019s death before her adulthood is real, but Mrs. Gumataotao is several years younger and their economic condition is sound.</p>\n    <p id=\"b292-7\">On the second matter of interference with the child by the natural mother, this Court, after advising counsel of its intention to investigate the records of the natural mother and baby at Juvenile Justice, and obtaining their consent, has satisfied itself that, although the natural mother would be an undesirable influence in the child\u2019s life, she has not, for a period of about a year, come by the Gumataotaos\u2019 premises; this includes a period prior to the termination hearing which has taken away her legal rights to the child.</p>\n    <p id=\"b293-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>There is no reason to assume that she will begin to do so now upon adoption.</p>\n    <p id=\"b293-3\">The negative factor which the Court considered in the case of placement with the Bardas is the fact that after fourteen (14) continuous months of care and unquestioned development in the Gumataotaos\u2019 home, the child will be faced with relocation to a new home, with new \u201cparents\u201d and a totally different atmosphere on the mainland.</p>\n    <p id=\"b293-4\">Practically speaking, this means there will be no opportunity for adjustment by steps into the new environment, with weekend visits and gradual assimilation into the new \u201cfamily\u201d unit from the old. It means instead, farewells, a plane trip (with a loving person but one who is still a stranger) and total removal from the atmosphere which has brought Jennifer from a condition of suspected retardation to the alert youngster this Court has seen.</p>\n    <p id=\"b293-5\">The Court is not willing to risk the effects of such a move on so delicate a nature as hers and thus will grant the adoption petition of the Gumataotaos and deny that of the Bardas.</p>\n    <p id=\"b293-6\">Counsel for the Gumataotaos will prepare the order.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Daly, </em>1 Guam R. 520 (1978).</p>\n    <p id=\"b581-9\">Furthermore, this Court is not willing at this time to decide that the state could <em>never </em>find conduct such as that of the defendant obscene. However, in the <em>Daly </em>decision the specific examples of conduct set forth in <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607 (1973), were read into Chapter 28, Article 2, so as to define specific sexual conduct. Those examples read as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b581-10\">(a) Patently offensive representation or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b581-11\">(b) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>The People apparently misread the <em>Miller </em>and <em>Daly </em>decisions since they argue that the examples are \u201cmerely illustrative, and not the beginning and end of the obscenity area.\u201d <em>Miller </em>required that an obscenity statute specifically define prohibited sexual conduct. True, the examples given in <em>Miller </em>were only illustrative of the type of conduct which could be specifically defined. However, where, as here, they have been adopted as specific examples of sexual conduct they <em>are </em>the beginning and end of the obscenity area. Sexual conduct not defined by statute cannot be criminal after <em>Miller.</em></p>\n    <p id=\"b582-5\">The defendant is charged with \u201cpulling and snuggling a customer to her breast in a public place.\u201d The most cursory reading of the <em>Miller </em>examples indicates that the defendant\u2019s alleged act is not included. The complaint herein fails to state a charge under \u00a7 28.50.</p>\n    <p id=\"b582-6\">It is not necessary to reach defendant\u2019s third argument.</p>\n    <p id=\"b582-7\">Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss is granted.</p>\n    <p id=\"b582-8\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

For the remainder of the term the rental would increase by 10 % every 5 years, compounded.</p>\n    <p id=\"b329-3\">Defendant was obligated by the lease to pay real estate taxes and provide public liability insurance for the protection of the plaintiff.</p>\n    <p id=\"b329-4\">Defendant failed to pay any rentals after January 1975, and failed to pay real estate taxes or provide liability insurance. Plaintiff served on defendants a Notice to Pay Rent for the period January 1,1975, to March 1,1975, and advised defendants that unless rent was paid within 5 days the plaintiff would elect to declare a forefeiture of said lease. On or or about April 21, 1975, plaintiff served defendants with a notice which recited the March 1975 notice, stated that defendants had failed to cure \u201cdefaults\u201d listed in March 1975 notice, and failed to pay 1974 real estate taxes. Such notice advised defendants that \u201cLessor, pursuant to the aforesaid lease, under paragraph (6) (b) (1) and (b) (c) of said lease <em>hereby terminates </em>said lease and will retake possession within three (3) days from the date hereof.\u201d Emphasis supplied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b329-5\">On July 18, 1975, plaintiff brought suit against defendants asking for:</p>\n    <p id=\"b329-6\">1. Rental for period from January 1, 1975, to April 1, 1975, for the amount of $3,500.00;</p>\n    <p id=\"b329-7\">2. Real Estate Taxes of $168.20 ;</p>\n    <p id=\"b329-8\">3.

For damages for breach and repudiation in the amount of $327,276.88, and</p>\n    <p id=\"b329-11\">6. For costs of suit.</p>\n    <p id=\"b330-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Trial was had on November 14, 1975, and the complaint was dismissed with respect to William Hsn in his individual capacity, leaving as the only defendant Central Development and Investment Corporation. It was stipulated that taxes owed to plaintiff from defendant amounted to $105.80 including 5% redemption charge. It was also stipulated that the current fair market rental for the property was $690.00 per month. The evidence showed that the property has at all pertinent times been unimproved. Relief demanded by paragraph 5 was computed by the plaintiff as being the difference between the contract rental and the fair market rental of $690.00 per month for the period of 58 years and 9 months.</p>\n    <p id=\"b330-3\">Defendant admitted liability for rental of $3,500.00 which was the amount owed at the time of termination of the lease by the plaintiff but denied liability for any period thereafter demanded by paragraphs 4 and 5 above.</p>\n    <p id=\"b330-4\">The issue in this case is the validity of Section 11(e) of the Lease entered into by the parties on January 21, 1974, which permits the lessor, upon the default of the lessee, to sue the lessee for the difference between the \u201ccontract rental\u201d and the \u201cpresent worth\u201d for the balance of the term, which in this case would be approximately 58 years. The validity of this provision will depend on whether or not said Section 11 (e) is a penalty and not enforceable or is valid as a provision for liquidated damages. See Sections 1670 and 1671 of the Civil Code of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b330-5\">The issue of rental acceleration clauses has been a difficult problem in California for many years. See 7 Hastings Law Journal 189 (1956) and 43 California Law Review 344 (1955).</p>\n    <p id=\"b330-6\">In <em>Moore v. Investment Properties </em>Corp., 71 F.2d 711 (9th Cir. 1934), the parties to a 15-year lease had provided that, upon stipulated conditions including repudiation of the lease, the lessor could terminate the lease and immedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ately recover from the lessee the difference between the value of the rentals provided for in the lease and the fair rental value of the property for the balance of the lease term. The lessee became bankrupt and repudiated the lease. The federal court held that, under California law, the provision for immediate recovery of damages was void.</p>\n    <p id=\"b331-3\"><em>Moore </em>was decided in 1984. In 1937, the California Legislature enacted Civil Code Section 3308, the first paragraph of which provides as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b331-4\">3308. The parties to any lease of real or personal property may agree therein that if such lease shall be terminated by the lessor by reason of any breach thereof by the lessee, the lessor shall thereupon be entitled to recover from the lessee the worth at the time of such termination, of the excess, if any, of the amount of rent and charges equivalent to rent reserved in the lease for the balance of the stated term or any shorter period of time over the then reasonable rental value of the premises for the same period.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b331-5\">Guam has never adopted Section 3308 of the California Civil Code, however, all other pertinent sections of the California Civil Code appear to be the same as Guam\u2019s. Therefore, it will necessarily follow that Guam must follow <em>Moore </em>and Section 11(e) of the lease is a penalty and unenforceable.</p>\n    <p id=\"b331-6\">However, other persuasive legal principles dictate that Section 11(e) of subject lease should be treated as a penalty, rather than as a provision for liquidated damages. These principles arise from the length of the lease, to wit: 60 years, and the great difference between the rental reserved in the lease and the reasonable rental value at the time of the termination of the lease. The authorities hold that in determining whether a provision is a penalty and so invalid, or is a valid provision for liquidated damages, the court should look into the question of reasonableness of the stipulated amounts and whether such amounts are proportionate to the probable damage. See annotations in 104 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>A.L.R. 223 and 106 A.L.R. 292. A lessor can, of course, sue periodically throughout the term of the lease as the rental payments fall due, but it appears unconscionable to permit him to select a time when rentals are depressed and use such depressed rentals as the measure of damages for the term of 60 years, ignoring the inevitability that rental value would increase in the future years. The black letter rule appears in <em>McCormick on Damages, </em>1935, page 606 as follows :</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b332-5\">Formerly the validity of agreements was said to depend on whether the intention of the parties was to agree on liquidated damages or to fix a penalty. This gave too great decisiveness to the descriptive items used in the contract, and to-day the courts will consider the language only as evidence upon the question, Was the sum intended as a pre-estimate of the actual loss? <em>But the decisive question in determining the issue is this, Was the amount named reasonably proportioned to the probable loss? The courts are tending to adopt this last as the sole test. </em>Emphasis supplied.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b332-6\">It is thus suggested that California courts would deny recovery demanded in paragraph 5 of the prayer in the case at bar in spite of Section 3308 of the California Civil Code.</p>\n    <p id=\"b332-7\">Judgment shall be entered for plaintiff in the amount of $3,605.80 plus costs.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

According to the appellant, an irregularity in the deed should have placed the defendant on notice that he was leasing land from two individuals who did not have valid title. The Court finds that the defendant had every right to rely on the deed in question which was duly recorded at the Department of Land Management. The irregularity that appellant complains of did not void the deed in any way and there was no way that the defendant could have been aware of any arguable defect in title when he leased the land.</p>\n    <p id=\"b486-7\">The Superior Court Judge correctly relied on <em>Wells v. Lizama, et al., </em>396 F.2d 877 (1968), in granting summary judgment. At page 883, <em>Wells </em>holds that \u201cthe essential purpose of the Guam Land Title Registration Act [is] to allow confident reliance upon record title under the Act\u201d. Appellant seeks to distinguish <em>Wells </em>on the ground that here on appeal any constructive notice as to a supposed irregularity in title would have come from the instrument itself rather than from the fact of another\u2019s possession of the land. (Appellant\u2019s Brief, page 3.) However, the court does not understand how under this argument the essential purpose of the Act (to allow reliance upon record title) would be any different.</p>\n    <p id=\"b486-8\">Furthermore, the supposed irregularity in the deed did not void title to the leased land. Appellant argues that since the granting clause did not name Enrique and Jose (the two lessors of the land to the defendant) but rather named \u201ctheir heirs and assigns\u201d, the lessor never took title and never had power to lease this land to the defendant. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>appellee correctly points out, it is not fatal to title if the grantee is not named in the granting clause as long as he is mentioned elsewhere and it seems certain that he was intended to be the grantee:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b487-3\">For an instrument purporting to be a deed to be effective as such, it must in some manner designate an existing person who is capable of taking title to the property. However, <em>the grantee need not be named in the granting clause. </em>If his name appears anywhere in the instrument with sufficient certainty to show that he is intended as grantee, the instrument is sufficient as a deed so far as the designation of a grantee is concerned. (Emphasis added.) 15 Cal. Jur.2d, Deeds, Sec. 54, pp. 453-454.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b487-4\">A quick perusal of the Deed of Gift makes it clear that Mrs. Rojas intended her sons Enrique and Jose as grantees. Their names are mentioned prominently at the beginning of the deed where it is stated that Mrs. Rojas is making the grant in consideration of the love and affection felt for her sons. Furthermore, the names of the sons are mentioned in the last paragraph where there can be little question that she intended them as grantees:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b487-5\">To have and to hold, all and singular, the said premises, together with the appurtenances, unto the said Enrique Castro Rojas and Jose Castro Rojas, their heirs and assigns forever.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b487-6\">Appellant offers no citation to support his argument that the deed was void. He states that Mrs. Rojas \u201cwas induced by her sons\u201d to execute the Deed of Gift, perhaps suggesting undue influence.

The defendant has not raised the constitutional issue of double jeopardy.</p>\n    <p id=\"b568-12\">California has a statute identical to \u00a7 654, Guam Penal Code. The seminal interpretation of that statute is <em>Kellett v. Superior Court, </em>63 Cal.2d 822, 409 P.2d 206 (1966). In that case the defendant pled guilty to exhibiting a firearm, a misdemeanor, and was subsequently indicted for being a felon in possession of a firearm, a felony. The Court granted a writ of prohibition dismissing the indictment, ruling that \u201cWhen, as here, the prosecution is or should be aware of more than one offense in which <em>the same </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number><em>act or course of conduct plays a significant part, </em>all such offenses must be prosecuted in a single proceeding.... Failure to unite all such offenses will result in a bar to subsequent prosecution of any offenses omitted if the initial proceedings culminate in either acquittal or conviction and sentence,\u201d <em>Kellett v. Superior Court, </em>supra at 827.</p>\n    <p id=\"b569-3\">Joinder in the case at hand is permitted under \u00a7 954, Guam Penal Code; clearly, the act and course of conduct of the defendant failing to yield at a stop sign will play a \u201csignificant part\u201d in his prosecution for both the offense of failing to yield and felony drunk driving. The one act resulted in two offenses.</p>\n    <p id=\"b569-4\">This was the conclusion of the controlling case of <em>In re Dennis B., </em>18 Cal.3d 687, 557 P.2d 514 (1976). The facts of this case are nearly identical to those of this one. The defendant there received a citation for improper lane change and was indicted for manslaughter resulting therefrom. The defendant was found guilty of the traffic violation and set forth \u00a7 654, California Penal Code, as a bar to the felony prosecution.</p>\n    <p id=\"b569-5\">The California Supreme Court accepted without comment that the two offenses arose out of the same criminal act, but held that \u00a7 654 was not a bar because the District Attorney did not know, nor should he have known, of the two prosecutions.</p>\n    <p id=\"b569-6\">There, as here, there was no evidence that any one Assistant Attorney General was actually aware of both prosecutions, especially in light of the summary procedure for prosecuting traffic offenses.</p>\n    <p id=\"b569-7\">In deciding whether or not the District Attorney should have known, the Court held in light of the circumstances the District Attorney was not unreasonable in not being aware of the two offenses. Those circumstances <em>are </em>that the potential for harassment and defendant\u2019s expense to defend a traffic offense are minimal. Further, the state has a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>stantial interest in maintaining the summary nature of traffic prosecutions. Also, the Court held that to deny the state the opportunity to prosecute a major felony would be a gross unfairness under any circumstances.</p>\n    <p id=\"b570-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n    <p id=\"b570-6\">Even though both offenses arise out of the same criminal course of conduct an essential element justifying dismissal under \u00a7 654 is absent; that the state knew or should have known about both offenses before the defendant\u2019s conviction. Basically, California in <em>In re Dennis B. </em>has decided as a matter of public policy that prior conviction for a traffic accident should not act as a bar to prosecution of an additional major felony.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

As provided by such section, the Island Court fined the appellant on each count an amount equal to one hundred times the amount of the unpaid taxes, or a total of $13,360.00, and ordered the appellant confined to jail until he worked out the fine at the rate of $3.00 per day, unless such fine is sooner paid, as provided for in Section 1446 of the Penal Code of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b20-7\">A summary of the evidence presented by the government will be of assistance in understanding the assignments of error. The United States Navy maintains an establishment at Point Asan in Guam, which is a military reservation, to provide housing, messing, recreation, etc., for civilian employees of the United States. Such employees maintain an organization known as Employees\u2019 Service Association and such association is allowed to purchase intoxicating liquor for resale to qualified members without being required to pay the internal revenue tax otherwise payable to the government of Guam. Each qualified member is furnished an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>identification card bearing his signature and may purchase liquor at the association store within prescribed limits.</p>\n    <p id=\"b21-3\">Before resale each bottle of liquor sold has attached to it a decalcomania or decal bearing a serial number. When the member makes a purchase, a purchase slip is issued showing his name, card number, purchase and the serial numbers of the bottles delivered to him.</p>\n    <p id=\"b21-4\">The appellant did not reside in such community, nor was he authorized to purchase liquor. He borrowed the identification card of a qualified purchaser and by representing himself to be such person made twenty-one purchases of liquor over a period of about forty-six days. The appellant was employed as a bartender and general handyman in a local tavern where he had a room. When it became apparent that unusually large purchases of liquor were being made by the appellant, who was then assumed to be the person he represented himself to be, the operations manager of the association notified the Office of Naval Intelligence. On the 10th day of August 1954 he followed the appellant after the appellant had made a purchase and saw him drive to and enter the tavern.</p>\n    <p id=\"b21-5\">Upon receipt of this information Naval Intelligence investigating officials went to the tavern some days later and followed a trash truck which had picked up trash at the tavern and at the dumping ground found empty bottles that bore the decal numbers which corresponded with purchases made by the appellant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b21-6\">A search warrant was issued by the Island Court for the tavern premises upon the assumption that there was probable cause that the appellant had acquired the liquor for sale over the bar at the tavern. Under the authority of such warrant the tavern premises were searched and four bottles of liquor, three of which were identified as having been sold to the appellant, were found and subsequently introduced in evidence.</p>\n    <p id=\"b22-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>When questioned by Naval Intelligence officers, the appellant readily admitted that he had purchased all of the liquor shown on the sales slips, denied that such purchases were for resale by the drink, and alleged that he had taken the liquor to the tavern or to friends for consumption by them or by him; that the empty bottles found at the dump had been placed in the tavern trash after the contents had been consumed by himself and friends elsewhere.</p>\n    <p id=\"b22-5\">From the foregoing it is clear that the government proved that by misrepresenting himself to be an authorized purchaser, the defendant purchased the liquor; that on one occasion he was followed as he transported it; that three bottles of liquor so sold were found at the tavern where he had a room; that some empty bottles were transported from the tavern to a public dump, and that the appellant admitted that all of the liquor so purchased had been transported either to the tavern or to a friend\u2019s house.</p>\n    <p id=\"b22-6\">In accordance with Rule 9 of the Appellate Rules of the District Court, counsel have waived oral argument on appeal and have stipulated as to the assignments of error upon which the appellant will rely. We first consider the question as to whether the judgment of conviction is contrary to the law and the evidence. While the parties have not briefed the question, we must determine whether the extra-judicial confession of the appellant is sufficiently corroborated. The government has .stipulated that its evidence consists of proof of purchases, the finding of three full bottles of liquor at the tavern and seven empty bottles at the dump, and the confession or admission of the appellant that he had in all instances transported the liquor after purchasing it. In addition there is the one instance when the appellant was followed. The appellant was convicted on the several counts of transporting over 150 bottles of liquor and as to all but a few the evidence is limited to purchases and the extrajudicial confession.</p>\n    <p id=\"b23-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The rule in this jurisdiction, at least in federal cases, and which we follow in this nonfederal case, is stated in <em>Davena v. United States, </em>198 F.2d 230.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b23-3\">\u201cHere it is established that the evidence corroborating a confession of the defendant need not independently prove the commission of the crime charged, neither beyond a reasonable doubt nor by a preponderance of proof.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b23-4\">In <em>Martin v. United States, </em>264 F. 950, the accused was charged with transporting intoxicating liquor from St. Joseph, Mo. to Hastings, Neb. 102 quarts of liquor were found at the residence of the accused in Nebraska and the accused told the officers making the seizure that he had transported it from Missouri on February 8, 1919. He pleaded guilty to a complaint in the county court of Adams County, Nebraska, charging him with transporting liquor from Missouri between the \u201c1st and the 10th day of February, A.D., 1919.\u201d The possession of the liquor, the statements to the officers, and the plea of guilty in the state court were relied upon to sustain the conviction. The court stated in part:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b23-5\">\u201cCounsel, however, maintain that the law is well settled that judicial confessions or admissions, uncorroborated by any other proof of the corpus delicti, are sufficient to support a conviction, and cites many cases in support of his position. It is true that a judicial confession or admission will support a conviction in the case in which it is made, because a plea of guilty is a waiver of proof in that case, and authorizes the court to render judgment against the defendant upon the plea. Counsel for the United States have cited, also, cases which hold that judicial confessions or admissions made in one case are admissible as evidence against the same defendant in other cases, where the plea can be said to admit facts which are relevant and material to the trial in which said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>confession or admission is offered as evidence. But admissibility and sufficiency to sustain a conviction are two very different propositions. It may be true that judicial confessions or admissions are admissible in other cases than those in which they were made; but this is not saying that, when they are admitted, they will sustain a conviction of the crime charged, without being corroborated by independent evidence of the corpus delicti. What the defendant in this case told the officers concerning the bringing of the whisky from St. Joseph, Mo. to Hastings, Neb. was clearly admissible; but it would not sustain a conviction, unless corroborated as above stated. So the fact that a judicial confession or admission made in one case may be admissible in another does not determine that such judicial confession or admission, when offered in a case other than that in which it was made, is still a judicial confession, and we find no authority which so holds. On the contrary, the text-writers on evidence say that when we leave the sphere of the same cause in which the judicial confession or admission was made, we leave behind all questions of judicial confessions or admissions. The judicial admission or confession, as we have before stated, is a waiver of proof in the case in which it is made; but when this effect ceases with the litigation itself, and we arrive at other litigation, and seek to resort to the parties\u2019 statements as embodied in the pleadings of prior litigations, we resort to them, not as judicial confessions or admissions, but as ordinary statements of the defendant, of no more importance, and of no higher character as proof, than other statements of the defendant tending to contradict his evidence or plea in the case on trial. Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 2, p. 1242, p. 1065; Chamberlayne on Evidence, vol. 2, p. 1283, pp. 1568-1624. It therefore results that the statements made by the defendant in the present case to the officers, and his statement made to the court when pleading to the above complaint in the county court for Adams County, Neb. were each and all extrajudicial confessions, and insufficient to support a verdict of guilty, unless corroborated by independent evidence of the corpus delicti.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b24-3\">In <em>Forte v. United States, </em>94 F.2d 236, the court reversed a conviction for transporting a stolen automobile found in possession of the accused some time after the theft when there was no proof that the accused knew it was stolen except his confession. In the <em>Forte </em>case the court held that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>understood the rule stated in <em>Pearlman v. United States, </em>10 F.2d 460, 9 Cir., as holding that the evidence, independent of a confession, need not touch the corpus delicti at all and refused to follow it.</p>\n    <p id=\"b25-3\">We believe that independent of the <em>Pearlman </em>case, the cases in this circuit indicate that at least the first steps in the proof of the corpus delicti were shown aliunde the extrajudicial confession, i.e. the fact of the specific loss or injury sustained. Wigmore on Evidence (3d Edition) Sec. 2072. Both <em>Smith v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 147 (1954), and <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>348 U.S. 160 (1954), are in accord with the general rule that an accused may not be convicted on his own uncorroborated confession; that to warrant a conviction there must be proof independent of the confession of the corpus delicti.</p>\n    <p id=\"b25-4\">The evidence of the fraudulent purchase of the liquor was properly admitted as incident to its unlawful transportation, <em>Billingsley v. United States, </em>274 F. 86. It would also appear that the evidence of the full and empty bottles bearing the decal numbers was properly admitted to show that there had been transportation of those particular purchases. Insofar as the purchases made when the appellant was followed, the charge was also proven.</p>\n    <p id=\"b25-5\">But we are unable to conclude that the various other offenses charged were shown to have been committed except by the confession. The obvious purpose of the code provision is to protect the internal revenue of Guam by making it illegal to transport liquor upon which the prescribed tax has not been paid. The purpose of the decals with numbers is to indicate that the liquor contained therein, is not subject to the tax when in possession of those authorized to purchase. In accordance with Section 653(1) of the code such authorized persons may not give or otherwise dispose of the liquor so purchased. Possession alone is not made an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>offense. We find no adequate corroboration of the offense of transportation, except as indicated supra.</p>\n    <p id=\"b26-5\">The appellant next contends that the section in question is too vague and indefinite to be constitutional. This 4s without merit. Regardless of what the legal position may be as regards an authorized purchaser of. liquor upon which the prescribed tax has not been paid, the appellant was not such a purchaser. After his misrepresentation in acquiring the liquor, any transportation was in violation of law.</p>\n    <p id=\"b26-6\">The appellant contends that the fine imposed was excessive and that the Island Court was without jurisdiction to impose it. The appellant was not convicted of one offense but of twenty-one offenses. While the fine imposed was a total one, it was broken down into fines for each offense, and it is conceded that such fines were properly computed. Section 82 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Guam vests jurisdiction in the Island Court in all criminal cases not amounting to felonies, <em>Government of Guam v. Pennington, </em>114 F.Supp. 907-911. Section 17 of the Penal Code of Guam provides:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b26-7\"><em>\u201cFelony and misdemeanor defined: </em>A felony is a crime which is: (a) Specifically declared to be a felony; or is (b) Punishable by death; or is (c) Punishable by imprisonment for not less than one year when not specifically declared to be a felony. A \u2018misdemeanor\u2019 is every other crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b26-8\">A fine is not a sentence of imprisonment. While it is true that, as originally convicted, the appellant, if unable to pay the fines, could be kept in jail for many years, that necessity would have resulted from his repeated violations and any request for suspension or probation would be properly addressed to the trial court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b26-9\">The judgment of the Island Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part with instructions to enter a judgment not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n      <p id=\"b20-8\"> Section 653, Penal Code of Guam. <em>Alcoholic beverages. Disposition, transport, drunkenness. </em>(1) Gift or other disposal: It shall be unlawful to give, or in any other way dispose of, intoxicating liquors upon which the internal revenue tax has not been paid into the treasury of the government of Guam. Anyone who violates this section shall be fined an amount equal to 100 times the amount of the tax involved. (2) Transportation: It shall be unlawful to transport intoxicating liquors on which the prescribed taxes have not been paid. Anyone who shall so do shall be fined 100 times the amount of the unpaid taxes. (3) Drunkenness: The penalty for being under the influences, of any intoxicant shall be a fine not to exceed $25, or by imprisonment not to exceed 30 days unless the offender is convicted of being a common drunkard, when Section 647 shall apply.</p>\n    </footnote>\n    <footnote label=\"2\">\n      <p id=\"b23-6\"> <em>Wiggins v.

Jose and Consolaci\u00f3n G. Iglesias the appellee herein. The court ordered that the appellants Jose and Bordallo deliver possession of the leasehold premises and that all rentals accrued from December 1968 to the date possession is delivered be paid to appellee. The trial was held on May 21, 1970 without a jury.</p>\n    <p id=\"b207-7\">Consolaci\u00f3n G. Iglesias, the appellee, owned a parcel of land known as Lots 1264, 1262 and 1266-2 Agana, Guam, which had some improvements. In order that she realize some income from the property she entered into a lease agreement for a term of twenty-five (25) years with a renewal option for an additional 25 years. The lease agreement was executed on June 22,1963 and the monthly rental was for two hundred and fifty ($250.00) and with graduated income to four hundred ($400.00) from the 11th year. Under the terms of the lease the appellant Jose was to undertake to commence new construction and make certain repairs. The trial record shows that there had been some discussion concerning building to be done by Jose, but nothing definite was in the final lease.</p>\n    <p id=\"b207-8\">One of the clauses of the said lease prohibited an assignment of the leasehold interest without the written consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>of the lessor. The record shows that on June 19,1964, Jose entered into an agreement with Ricardo J. Bordallo d.b.a. Ricky\u2019s Auto Company. Jose attempted to obtain the consent of Iglesias to the arrangement, but after failing, proceeded without such consent.. The Jose-Bordallo arrangement \u201csubleased\u201d the entire premises ,to Bordallo for five (5) years with 9 options to renew for five years each. Rental under this agreement was the same as that provided in the original lease. Jose later told Iglesias or her representative that the \"arrangements were merely temporary. The lessor then accepted rental payments from Ricky\u2019s Auto on that understanding.</p>\n    <p id=\"b208-5\">The trial record further shows that in July 1968 the lessor discovered the Jose-Bordallo deal was more than temporary. Upon further inquiry she also learned that certain other promises made in the lease were not being fulfilled by Jose. Therefore, on July 30, 1968, the lessor sent a notice to Jose reciting breaches of the lease agreement and giving him until August 31, 1968 ,to cure the stated breaches. The record shows that Jose did nothing to cure the breaches.</p>\n    <p id=\"b208-6\">After August 31, 1968, rental payments were tendered to the lessor who refused to cash them until her attorney advised her that doing so would not compromise her position. The checks having been cashed, carried an endorsement attempting to preserve the lessor\u2019s position. Jose does not contend seriously that there has been a breach of the lease. His main contention is that the lessor waived any breach when the rental payments were cashed after August 31,1968.</p>\n    <p id=\"Aea\">It is well settled law, that a covenant not to assign is a continuing one. Here there is nothing to show knowledge of the breach until after July 1968. The determining factor in this case is the effect of cashing of the rental checks after August 31, 1968. If the record showed only that the checks were cashed, without more, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>could be little doubt as to what the decision of this court would be. The record here shows that the lessor did not want to waive the breach and cashed the check only after being assured by her attorney that it would have no effect on the dispute. That advice as given was not good. The lessor however should not be penalized for accepting inaccurate advice from an expert in law. The rule that a client is bound by the acts of his attorney applies to cases where a mistake of Judgment has been made. In this case, the mistake was one of law.</p>\n    <p id=\"b209-3\">The parties to this action have called upon the equity rules of this Court. Jose,.who attempted subterfuge to put Bordallo in possession, cannot now be given a windfall because of the lessors reliance on her attorney\u2019s advice. Citing <em>Northwestern Pac. R. Co. v.

As a basis for its decree the court found that the appellant and the appellee entered into an oral agreement in 1946 for the purchase and sale of the land for $500.00 and free electric light service by the appellee; that at that time the title to the land was in an estate, but such title was to be deeded by the administratrix to appellant\u2019s father, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>had agreed to convey it to appellant; that in reliance upon the oral agreement, the appellee built a house valued at $5,000.00 on the land and otherwise complied with the agreement but that when the appellant obtained title to the land he refused to deed it to appellee. The court found that there was a sufficient partial performance on the part of the appellee to take the agreement out of the Statute of Frauds.</p>\n    <p id=\"b15-3\">The findings of the Island Court are not, however, supported by the evidence. No contract existed. In addition to the transcript and record we have a report on a conference and stipulations entered into between the parties pursuant to Rule 9 of the Appellate Rules of the District Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An analysis of the testimony and admissions, construed in the appellee\u2019s favor, shows the following: The appellee was required to give up his home in the city of Agana in 1946 and he contacted the appellant and asked if he could build a house on appellant\u2019s land. The appellant informed him that the land belonged to appellant\u2019s father, who gave permission to build the house. There was at that time no discussion of the sale of the land or purchase price. The parties simply agreed where the house should be built. The appellee built his house and afterward approached the appellant\u2019s father to purchase the land but was informed that as there were no taxes being levied it was not necessary to sell. The appellant did not obtain title to the land until December 1953. The appellant furnished certain power and light without charge to the appellee. The appellee offered to pay $500.00 for the land and subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>quently had a deed prepared, but there is no evidence that the appellant ever accepted payment, and the money was paid into court. Apparently Chief Judge Manibusan of the Island Court attempted to get the interested parties to agree upon a settlement, but this did not succeed. The appellant\u2019s father urged the appellant to transfer the land for the consideration offered in order to keep faith with the appellee.</p>\n    <p id=\"b16-3\">There is no question of fraud or misrepresentation here. The appellee knowingly built a house on land not owned by the appellant in the expectation that the appellant would eventually own the land and would be amenable to its sale. No price was mentioned until after the house was built (Tr. p. 16), nor was any survey made of the land involved and such land was only a portion of the lot. At one time in 1947 the appellee paid rent for the land to the appellant because occupants of another portion of the lot were paying rent (Tr. p. 15).</p>\n    <p id=\"b16-4\">In these circumstances was the Island Court warranted in ordering specific performance of the alleged agreement to sell the land? Under Section 1624<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Civil Code of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Guam an agreement for the sale of real property is invalid unless the contract is in writing and subscribed by the person to be charged or his agent. Under Section 1971<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Code of Civil Procedure of Guam, conveyance of real property must be executed by the grantor or his agent, but under Section 1972<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is not to be construed:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b17-3\">\u201cto abridge the power of any court to compel the specific performance of an agreement, in case of part performance thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b17-4\">These provisions were taken from the California Codes and may be construed in the light of California decisions, <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>9 Cir., 181 F.2d 577. Before the appellee is entitled to specific performance of the contract under the doctrine of partial performance, the acts of part performance, in order to be effective to remove an oral agreement from the operation of the Statute of Frauds, must be referable to and induced by the contract relied upon and must have been done with a view to its complete performance, 49 Am.Jur. 428. And acts performed before the making of the oral contract sought to be enforced or which are merely preliminary, preparatory or ancillary to the contract sought to be enforced are not sufficient as part performance. Thus, expenditures incurred prior to the making of the agreement and in contemplation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>of the subsequent purchase of the property or improvements made or labor performed anterior to the date of the parol agreement do not constitute a part performance thereof, 49 Am.Jur. 431.</p>\n    <p id=\"b18-5\">California decisions follow these principles. In <em>Forbes v. City of Los </em>Angeles, 101 Cal.App. 781, 281 P. 528, the court stated:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b18-6\">\u201cAttention has not been called to any decision in this state holding that an oral contract for the sale of real property can be specifically enforced in the absence of part performance thereof. As shown by the terms of Section 1741, the part performance relied upon must be part performance of the contract sought to be enforced. As stated in <em>Knoff v. Graces, </em>68 Colo. 527, 190 P. 526, \u2018Part performance must be part performance, i.e. it must be the performance of something required by the statute. . . . Doing of something because of the contract, or in reliance on it, is not enough.\u2019 The acts of part performance must be referable alone to the contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b18-7\">We note that the defense of the Statute of Frauds was not specifically raised in the appellant\u2019s answer, but since it is clear that it was raised and argued on his demurrer to the complaint and no question of waiver is presented or argued in this appeal, we do not consider the question, 49 Am.Jur. 601, at seq. Nor do we consider other errors assigned by appellee.</p>\n    <p id=\"b18-8\"> Undoubtedly, in arriving at his conclusions, the Island Court judge took into consideration the fact that in 1946 Guam was beginning to emerge from almost total destruction of housing, the much cheaper value of land than in 1953, the informality of Guam business customs, especially when friends or family were involved, and other purely local factors. But these are insufficient for courts to establish a precedent at variance with established law. The judgment and decree of the Island Court are reversed with instructions to deny the decree of specific performance.</p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n      <p id=\"b15-4\"> Rule 9. Oral Arguments. When a quorum is available to hear oral arguments on appeal the clerk of the court will advise counsel as to the time and place for such arguments. However, the parties may agree that oral argument may be waived and that a determination of the appeal may be made on the record and briefs without the necessity for the presence of the additional judge or judges in Guam. In that event the judge of the District Court, on appeals from the Island Court, shall have the right to call counsel for the parties into conference for the purpose of clarifying points at issue. He shall append his report of such conference to the record.</p>\n    </footnote>\n    <footnote label=\"2\">\n      <p id=\"b16-5\"> Sec. 1624. What contracts must be written.

An agreement for the leasing for a longer period than 1 year, or for the sale of real property, or of an interest therein; and such agreement, if made by an agent of the party sought to be charged, is invalid, unless the authority of the agent is in writing, subscribed by the party sought to be charged;</p>\n      <p id=\"A3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>6.

On appeal he does not contend that he did not violate this section if the jurisdiction of the government of Guam extends to the submerged land upon which the weir was constructed. The appellant contends that only one question is presented on the- appeal and that is as to whether the United States has title to submerged lands or tidelands adjacent to Guam. The appellant then cites a number of cases which held, in eifect, that the title to such lands is in the United States. The appellant might well have cited the opinion of the Solicitor for the Department of the Interior issued under date of January 31,1958, M-36449. In that opinion the Solicitor held that tidelands and submerged lands adjacent to Guam are owned by the United States and that the government of Guam has no administrative jurisdiction over such lands. As a result of this opinion the United States Congress enacted specific legislation to vest conditional title in the government of Guam to certain built-up land.</p>\n    <p id=\"b81-3\">In its brief the government relies largely upon the District Court opinion in the case of <em>United States of America, </em>Plaintiff, <em>v. Jesus D. Borja, et al., </em>Defendants. This was a case in which the United States charged the defendants with illegal fishing by explosives. The District Court held that the designation \u201cGuam\u201d included the adjacent waters; that in the Fish Restoration and Management Projects Act, as amended, 16 U.S.C.A. 777, et seq., the Congress recognized the interests of the government of Guam in such submerged lands; and that under the Organic Act of Guam the government of Guam was given control over such lands.</p>\n    <p id=\"b81-4\">The present Judge of the District Court is in disagreement with certain portions of the <em>Borja </em>opinion, but it is not necessary in the instant ease to determine the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>as to whether the United States is the exclusive owner of such lands, or whether the government of Guam has been given control over such lands. Section 631 of the Penal Code of Guam as printed by the United States Government Printing Office in 1947 contained the following provision:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b82-5\"><em>\u201cProtection of fish. Fishweirs. </em>\u2014 (1) It is prohibited for any person to build or construct any fishweir without a license therefor.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b82-6\">\u201c (2) The leaders or wings of fishweirs shall not exceed 100 yards in length, not including the sides of the pound. The distance between fishweirs shall not be less than 150 yards. No part of any fishweir shall be placed within 50 yards of any channel suitable for water transportation by small boats through the reefs or within 15 yards of the beach at low water, or within 200 yards of the discharge from any sewage pipe.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b82-7\">This provision was in effect at the time the Organic Act of Guam was enacted. Section 12308 of the Government Code of Guam was enacted in 1956 as a modification of the previously-existing law. Section 12308 provides:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b82-8\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to place or maintain a fish-weir in the waters of Guam unless he holds a valid permit from the Director. Such a permit shall be issued by the Director when he has determined that such weir will be located and constructed so as not to unjustly restrict the fishing of others nor result in the violation of provisions of this Article and supporting regulations. A fee of one dollar ($1.00) per weir shall be paid to the Department for such a permit which shall be valid for only one year from date of issuance. The owner shall remove such weir from the water within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the permit unless the permit is otherwise renewed.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b82-9\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for an owner of a fishweir to leave such weir in the waters of Guam unattended for a period of fifteen (15) days.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b82-10\">It will be noted that both laws prohibit fishweirs without a permit. In the case of <em>Silvestrie C. Mafnas v. The Government of Guam, </em>228 F.2d, Ninth Circuit (1955), the Court stated:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b83-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\u201cMafnas appeals from a judgment and sentence of the United States District Court of Guam based upon an information charging him of involuntary manslaughter, a crime created by Congress in its provision in Section 25(a) of the Guam Organic Act (64 Stat. 384, 390-391).</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b83-3\">\u2018The laws of Guam in force on the date of enactment of this Act, except as amended by this Act, are hereby continued in force, subject to modification or repeal by the Congress of the United States or the Legislature of Guam, and all laws of Guam inconsistent with the provisions of this Act are hereby repealed to the extent of such inconsistency.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b83-4\">Under the <em>Mafnas </em>case the penal laws of Guam in existence at the time of the passage of the Organic Act were considered offenses created by Congress, and in the absence of a showing that the prohibition against fishweirs is in conflict with any law of the United States, the offense of which the appellant was convicted was an offense defined by Congress.</p>\n    <p id=\"b83-5\">However, it is not necessary to rely exclusively on the <em>Mafnas </em>case to support this conviction. A pilot case in the jurisdictional field is <em>Gromer, Treasurer of Porto Rico v. Standard Dredging Co., </em>224 U.S. 362 (1912). This case holds that the distinction made between local control of property and the exercise of government is a substantial one, and that even though a harbor area had been reserved to the United States, a dredge operating in the harbor was subject to the taxing power of Puerto Rico. A reading of this case convinces us that regardless of title to tidelands and submerged lands, the government of Guam was given jurisdiction over these areas in the application of its laws not in conflict with those of the United States. The conviction below is affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The complaint and the summons were served on the defendant-appellee on December 27, 1969. The summons required that the defendant answer the complaint within twenty days. On January 23, 1970, a deputy clerk signed the default, and judgment was signed by a judge of the Island Court. The default and the judgment were filed at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>9:23 A.M., January 27, 1970 and entered in the docket on the same day.</p>\n    <p id=\"b219-3\">At 9:23 A.M., January 27, 1970, the defendant filed his answer ,to the complaint.</p>\n    <p id=\"b219-4\">On April 30, 1971, the defendant\u2019s attorney moved for an order vacating the judgment. On June 8,1971, an order vacating the judgment was filed and entered in the docket. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n    <p id=\"b219-5\">The appellant appeals upon the ground that the Island Court was without authority to vacate the judgment under Rule 60(b) (1) of the Rules of Civil Procedure for the Island Court because the motion came more than a year after the judgment. It is not clear from the record whether the court vacated the judgment under Rule 60(b)(1) or 60 (b) (6).

Palomo was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon for his role in aiding and abetting an attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>shooting of a Guam police officer, Sergeant Frank Sab\u00edan. Direct evidence of the defendant\u2019s participation in the crime was provided by the testimony of Bennie Gogue, one of three other persons involved in the shooting incident. He testified that Patrick Palomo joined in the discussion of shooting Officer Sab\u00edan and was present in his red Datsun pickup on both occasions when shots were fired into the Sab\u00edan house. Corroborative evidence was provided by two of Sablan\u2019s neighbors who testified to seeing a vehicle similar to that usually driven by Patrick Palomo at the scene of the shootings. One of the neighbors also testified that the driver of the red Datsun pickup had a hairstyle somewhat similar to that of the defendant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b524-3\">The People also called Vincent Palomo, cousin of the defendant and another of the participants in the assault on Officer Sab\u00edan and his family, as a Government witness. Vincent testified that the defendant was not at the scene during the shootings, and denied ever making a statement to the contrary. The People were permitted to counter with Vincent\u2019s prior inconsistent statement that Patrick had been present. Defense counsel vigorously objected to the admissibility of the prior statement on the ground that it had been coerced by a threat to certify Vincent for trial as an adult. The trial court denied a defense request that the court make a preliminary determination of voluntariness, ruling that evidence of coercion went to the weight rather than the admissibility of Vincent\u2019s prior statement.</p>\n    <p id=\"b524-4\">The defendant\u2019s first two appellate contentions attack the sufficiency of the evidence. The defendant first contends that there was insufficient evidence to corroborate the accomplice testimony of Bennie Gogue. Assuming adequate corroboration, the defendant next contends that the evidence as a whole was insufficient to prove that the defendant was an active participant in rather than a passive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>observer of the offense charged. The evidence in this case was far from overwhelming, but viewing it in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, as we must, we cannot say that it is insufficient either as to corroboration or proof of the defendant\u2019s active participation.</p>\n    <p id=\"b525-3\">Evidence corroborating the testimony of an accomplice is sufficient to avoid appellate reversal if it \u201creasonably tend[s] to connect a defendant with the commission of a crime.\u201d <em>People v. Perry, </em>7 C.3d 756, 774, 103 Cal. Rptr. 161, 499 P.2d 129 (1972). The testimony of Sergeant Sablan\u2019s two neighbors meets this test. Their undisputed testimony that a red Datsun pickup, identical to one usually driven by the defendant, raced through the Sab\u00edan neighborhood with its lights off at the time of both shootings reasonably tends to connect the defendant with the assault on the Sab\u00edan household.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The existence of plausible explanations for the presence of the red Datsun pickup other than evidencing the presence, support and encouragement of this defendant \u201cis relevant to the weight of the evidence . . . but not to its admissibility or sufficiency for the purpose of corroboration.\u201d <em>People v. Perry, </em>id. at 773-774.</p>\n    <p id=\"b525-4\">The defendant also attacks the sufficiency of the evidence as a whole claiming that it only proves him to have been a passive observer of a crime committed by others. He asserts that the following crucial testimony of Bennie Gogue is too ambiguous and incomplete to support a finding that he was an active participant in the Sab\u00edan shooting incident.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b525-5\">Q. What, if anything, did Eddie Olsen say at this time when you met him at the house?</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>A. Just to shoot \u2014 what\u2019s his name \u2014 just to shoot Serg-eant Sab\u00edan.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b526-5\">Q. Serg-eant Frank Sab\u00edan?</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b526-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b526-7\">Q. Was Patrick Palomo here at that discussion ?</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b526-8\">A. Yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b526-9\">Q. Do you remember whether Patrick Palomo joined in that conversation?</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b526-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b526-11\">Reporter\u2019s Transcript, p. 134, lines 4-14.</p>\n    <p id=\"b526-12\">The defendant complains that this testimony is ambiguous in that it is unclear whether Gogue\u2019s \u201cYes\u201d response meant that Patrick Palomo joined in the conversation or that Gogue <em>remembered </em>whether he did. He further complains that the testimony is incomplete because it does not reveal the extent or nature of Patrick Palomo\u2019s participation in the conversation. But on appeal we must assume that the jury resolved ambiguity and incompleteness in favor of the prevailing party. Therefore, otherwise sufficient evidence is not rendered insufficient by speculation premised on the opposite assumption. Furthermore, it was the responsibility of defendant\u2019s trial counsel, not the prosecutor, to eliminate the ambiguity and incompleteness by fleshing out Gogue\u2019s testimony on this point during cross-examination. As an appellate court we can only assume that defense counsel\u2019s failure to do so sprang from a conscious recognition that clarification or amplification of this crucial portion of Gogue\u2019s testimony would not be beneficial to his client.</p>\n    <p id=\"b526-13\">The defendant\u2019s third appellate contention poses a difficult and rarely raised legal issue: must a trial judge make a preliminary determination that a statement by a witness, <em>other than the defendant, </em>was made voluntarily? Were there not two excellent appellate opinions discussing this issue, we would be compelled to discuss it at length. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>LaFrance v. Bohlinger, </em>499 F.2d 29 (1st Cir. 1974) and <em>People v. Underwood, </em>61 C.2d 113, 37 Cal. Rptr. 313, 389 P.2d 937 (1964), however, make extended discussion unnecessary. We accept the reasoning of the First Circuit and its holding:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b527-3\">. . . [When] there is a substantial claim <em>by </em>the defendant that the impeaching statement offered by the Government was obtained by police threats and other blatant forms of physical and mental duress . . . the court has a duty to conduct its own inquiry and to exclude the statement if found to have been unconstitutionally coerced.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b527-4\"><em>LaFrance v. Bohlinger, </em>supra at 35; accord, <em>People v. Underwood, </em>id.</p>\n    <p id=\"b527-5\">There was a substantial claim raised by defendant that Vincent Palomo\u2019s impeaching statement was obtained by threatening him with trial as an adult for his part in the Sab\u00edan assault.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court did not make its own inquiry into this claim. Therefore, this case must be remanded for a determination of whether Vincent Palomo voluntarily gave the statement used to impeach his trial testimony. If, after holding an evidentiary hearing and considering the totality of the circumstances,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the trial court is convinced by a preponderance of the evidence<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the statement was made voluntarily, the defendant will be entitled to no further relief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the other hand, should the court conclude that the statement was coerced by a threat to subject Vincent to trial as an adult, the statement must be suppressed and the defendant retried.</p>\n    <p id=\"b527-6\">The defendant\u2019s final appellate contention is that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct sufficiently serious to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>require reversal. We have carefully examined each of the defendant\u2019s claims of prosecutorial misconduct and find them neither singly nor collectively adequate to warrant reversal. This should not be construed, however, as an appellate seal of approval for the prosecutorial conduct complained of. The prosecutor, particularly in his misuse of Vincent Palomo\u2019s impeaching statement in his closing argument, at times treads dangerously close to misconduct of reversible dimensions.</p>\n    <p id=\"b528-5\">This case is remanded for the aforementioned determination of voluntariness. In all other respects the conviction is affirmed.</p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n      <p id=\"b525-6\"> This conclusion, although not dependent on the somewhat speculative testimony of Mary Lou Griffen regarding the similarity of the defendant\u2019s hairstyle to that of the driver of the red Datsun pickup on the night in question, is, nonetheless, bolstered by this additional bit of circumstantial evidence.</p>\n    </footnote>\n    <footnote label=\"2\">\n      <p id=\"b527-7\"> Vincent Palomo testified under oath that Detective Palacios threatened to certify him for adult prosecution if he did not cooperate.

The defendant was represented by Joan Baumgarten and the territory of Guam was represented by David Williams. The motion was heard before the Honorable Richard H. Benson on November 22, 1978, and January 2, 1979, and decision was reserved.</p>\n    <p id=\"b637-6\">The territory of Guam raised the threshold issue of defendant\u2019s standing to challenge the search. Defendant has a substantial possessory interest in the premises searched as a resident of the apartment. The Court finds that defendant meets the criteria established for standing by the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Jones v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 258, 80 S.Ct. 725 (1960).</p>\n    <p id=\"b637-7\">Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress is premised on the alleged failure of the affidavit to establish probable cause. The Court notes that affidavits should be tested in \u201ca common-sense and realistic fashion\u201d, and reviewing courts should \u201cnot invalidate the warrant by interpreting the affidavit in a hypertechnical, rather than a commonsense, manner\u201d. <em>United States v. Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 104, 85 S.Ct. 741 (1965).</p>\n    <p id=\"b637-8\">Probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant can be established by the timeworn procedure of searching an informant, \u201cfinding him to be without money or drugs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>supplying him with money, watching him enter the premises and leave it, and finally searching him to determine that the money had been spent and drugs obtained\u201d. <em>United States v. </em>McKetham, 247 F.Supp. 324 at 327 (1965). The District Court of Guam in <em>United States v. William Pangelinan, </em>D.C. Criminal Case No. 78-000 28, found probable cause extant on the basis of this methodology. In the instant case, the affiant did not accompany the informant to the residence. Rather, the affiant stopped his vehicle one-quarter mile from the defendant\u2019s residence. He then waited at that location several minutes before observing the informant driving towards him. During that time the informant was not, and could not, be continually observed by the affiant. Defendant\u2019s apartment is located in a residential area in which there are numerous other dwelling houses. The control necessary to provide probable cause through the above-mentioned procedure was not present.</p>\n    <p id=\"b638-5\">Another construction posited is that it is an affidavit in which the affiant\u2019s testimony relies upon the anonymous tip of the informant, CRI. Under this construction, the affidavit must meet the two-prong test of <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509 (1964). The court finds that the affidavit does not adequately comply with the second prong of the <em>Aguilar </em>test. That prong requires that \u201cthe affidavit state sufficient underlying circumstances establishing the reliability or credibility of the informant\u201d. White-bread, Constitutional Criminal Procedure 49 (1st ed. 1978). The affidavit sets forth the facts of two prior controlled buys in which the informant, CRI, was followed to within one block of the residence from which he purchased the controlled substance. These facts are illustrative of CRI\u2019s reliability as a vehicle for a controlled buy. They do not state sufficient circumstances establishing CRI\u2019s reliability or credibility in providing tips to the affiant or other police officers.</p>\n    <p id=\"b639-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584 (1969), provides an alternative route to the establishment of the credibility prong. Corroboration through independent police observation can validate a tip found inadequate under <em>Aguilar. </em>However, the affidavit does not contain independent police observation of criminal activity at the defendant\u2019s residence.</p>\n    <p id=\"b639-3\">For the aforementioned reasons, defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress is granted.</p>\n    <p id=\"b639-4\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Upon completion, the defendant issued plaintiffs a Warranty of Completion (Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit #4) which provided in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b502-9\">Provided, however, that this warranty shall apply only to such instances of substantial nonconformity as to which the Purchaser (s)/Owner (s) or his (their) successors or transferees shall have given written notice to the Warrantor at any time or times within 1 year from the date of original conveyance of title to such Purchaser (s)/Owner (s) or the date of initial occupancy of the dwelling, whichever first occurs. Provided further however, that in the event the Purchaser (s) /Owner (s) acquired title to the captioned property prior to completion of construction of the dwelling thereon, such notice of nonconformity to the Warrantor may be given to any time or times within 1 year from the date of completion or initial occupancy of such dwelling, whichever first occurs.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b502-10\">The basic facts of this case are not in dispute. It is clear that the above warranty was to run from June 19, 1974, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>to June 19, 1975, which, was about the time the plaintiffs moved into their completed home. (RT 39:4 to 40:17.) There is no dispute that certain plumbing defects in the house became known at least in April 1975 (RT 41:24 to 42:18); however, the construction company does question whether it received notice of the defective plumbing and whether it promised that some action would be taken to cure the leak. The law seems clear that even though the Warranty of Completion entered into between the parties required written notice, if the plaintiffs (through a representative) had contacted the construction company and were assured that the problem would be corrected, and if they relied upon that assurance to their detriment, Pacific Construction would be estopped from raising as a defense the lack of written notice. <em>Wade v.

(RT 128; Exhibit #10.) Also there can be no question that the plaintiffs relied on Mr. Felix\u2019s statement that the situation was being taken care of. (RT 51:21; 112:14 to 114:22; 118; 119:18.)

The Island Court issued an alternative writ of mandate to the appellee, the Governor of Guam. The Governor moved to quash and answered. After oral argument the Island Court quashed the alternative writ and denied a peremptory writ. This appeal followed.. We agree that the courts of Guam have no jurisdiction to require the Governor to appoint a Commissioner for the Municipality of Agana when the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>fice becomes vacant as such appointment involves the exercise of a discretion vested in the Governor over the exercise of which the courts have no control.</p>\n    <p id=\"b170-6\">The office of municipal commissioner in Guam is an elective office. Section 15007 of the Government Code originally-required that any vacancy in the office was to be filled by special election but this provision was changed by Public Law 6-81, effective March 11, 1962, to provide:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b170-7\">Vacancies in the office of Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner shall be filled by appointment of the Governor of Guam by and with the advice and consent of the Guam Legislature, and such appointee shall serve the unexpired portion of the term for which his predecessor was elected and qualified.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b170-8\">Section 15011(f) of the Government Code provides that if there is no Assistant Commissioner the Chief Commissioner shall perform the duties of Commissioner until the vacancy is filled by special election. We first note that Section 15007 requires that a vacancy shall be filled by appointment of the Governor of Guam, but it does not provide who shall be appointed or when he shall be appointed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b170-9\">The famous case of <em>Marbury v. Madison, </em>1 Cranch 137; 2 L.Ed. 60, established the principle that the Secretary of State of the United States could be required by the courts to deliver an appointment commission even though the President had directed him not to do so. In <em>Marbury </em>the appointment had been made. The Secretary of State was required to perform only a ministerial act. The books are replete with cases involving the authority of state courts to require governors to perform ministerial functions or to refrain from acts which were in violation of law. We rely heavily on <em>Felix v. Government of the Virgin Islands, </em>167 F.Supp. 702. In <em>Felix </em>the opinion was prepared by now Senior Circuit Judge Albert B. Maris, who was sitting by assignment as Judge of the Virgin Islands District Court. One of the issues involved the question as to whether the Governor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>the Virgin Islands was subject to mandate for authorizing the removal of a classified employee without complying with a law which gives such employee a right to file a written statement contesting his removal.</p>\n    <p id=\"b171-3\">The opinion states in part:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b171-4\">The defendant contends that this court is without power to direct a mandatory order to the Governor because the exercise of his official duties is not subject to control or review by the courts. I agree that this is true with respect to actions of the Governor which involve the exercise by him of the discretionary and political power which is conferred upon him by the Eevised Organic Act as head of the executive branch of the territorial government. As to such matters his action is final and unreviewable. But the same is not necessarily true as to purely ministerial acts of the Governor not involving the exercise of discretion or judgment or as to acts which are prohibited to him by law.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b171-5\">The opinion quotes with approval the following from <em>Martin v. Ingham </em>(1888), 38 Kan. 641, 17 P. 162:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"AOG\">The only acts of public functionaries which the courts ever attempt to control by either injunction or mandamus, are such acts only as are in their nature strictly ministerial; and a ministerial act is one which a public officer or agent is required to perform upon a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of legal authority, and without regard to his own judgment or opinion concerning the propriety or impropriety of the act to be performed ....</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b171-7\">Keference to the Organic Act of Guam, 48 U.S.C.A. 1421, et seq., will clearly indicate that the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in legislation does not necessarily eliminate the exercise of discretion. Under Section 1421g the Governor shall establish, maintain and operate public health services; shall provide an adequate public educational system. Under 1422 (a) he shall have general supervision and control of all executive agencies. Under 1422c (a) the Governor shall, except as otherwise provided in this chapter or the laws of Guam, appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the legislature, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>all heads of executive agencies and instrumentalities, but under 1422c (b) the Governor may appoint or remove any officer whose appointment or removal is not otherwise provided for. And under 1422 the Governor shall be appointed by the President. It would not be contended that any court can require the President to appoint a Governor until he sees fit to do so, 14 Am. Jur. 396.</p>\n    <p id=\"b172-5\">Whether the person to be appointed is to be the head of an executive agency or a municipal Commissioner is solely a matter of degree. The Governor is held responsible for the appointment. He must exercise his discretion in determining: whether a suitable person is available, whether such person will be satisfactory to the legislature, whether the selection of one person will offend the legislative sponsors of others and possibly spark conflict between the Executive and the Legislative. Whether, when the work is being done by the Chief Commissioner, it is best to wait until the people make their selection at election time? In any event, and fortunately so, the courts may neither help nor hinder the Governor in the discretionary exercise of the appointive power.

The motion was heard on October 5, 1978, and decision was reserved.</p>\n    <p id=\"b623-15\">Defendant seeks to suppress heroin seized from his person under a warrant executed on September 9, 1978. Defendant was searched pursuant to the \u201cpersons present therein\u201d language of the search warrant. It is defendant\u2019s contention that this violates his rights under \u00a7 35.20(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>of the Criminal Procedure Code and the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b624-5\">Section 35.20(b) and the Fourth Amendment require a warrant to particularly describe the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. The issue presented by defendant is whether presence at a specified place is a constitutionally sufficient description of a person to allow a search under a warrant. Defendant cites <em>State v. De Simone, </em>288 A.2d 849 (1972), and <em>People v. Nieves, </em>330 N.E.2d 26 (1975), in support of his position that the description \u201cpersons present therein\u201d is inadequate and therefore fails as a general warrant. However, both these cases recognized that under certain circumstances \u201cpersons present therein\u201d language is sufficiently descriptive to satisfy the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b624-6\">In <em>State v. De Simone, </em>288 A.2d 849, a passenger in a car was searched under a warrant directing a search of a specifically described automobile and \u201cany and all persons found therein.\u201d The automobile had been observed participating in a floating lottery drop. The court upheld the search. Addressing the question of the sufficiency of a description in a warrant under the Fourth Amendment, the court stated:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b624-7\">And, with regard to the Fourth Amendment demand for specificity as to 'the subject to be searched, there is none of the vice of a general warrant if the individual is thus identified by physical nexus to the on-going criminal event itself. In such a setting, the officer executing the warrant has neither the authority nor the opportunity to search everywhere for anyone violating a law. So long as there is good reason to suspect or believe that anyone present at the anticipated scene will probably be a participant, presence becomes the descriptive fact satisfying the aim of the Fourth Amendment. The evil of the general warrant is thereby negated. To insist nonetheless that the individual be otherwise described when circumstances will not permit it, would simply deny Government a needed power to deal with crime, without advancing the interest the Amendment was meant to serve. 288 A.2d at 851.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b625-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>In <em>People v. Nieves, </em>830 N.E.2d 26, the court found the particular circumstances of that case did not support a reasonable inference that any person present at the restaurant and cocktail lounge possessed gambling records. However, the court clearly pointed out that \u201cany person present\u201d language could, in some circumstances, survive constitutional attack. The court stated that:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b625-3\">. . . what will amount to forbidden generality or, to put it another way, insufficient particularity in a warrant necessarily depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 330 N.E.2d at 32.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b625-4\">Upon similar facts and circumstances to the case at bar, the court in <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, </em>348 N.E.2d 101 (1976), held the warrant to be constitutionally sufficient. In that case, heroin was found on defendant\u2019s person during a search pursuant to a warrant for the apartment, the known occupant, and \u201cany person present who may be found to have heroin in his possession or under his control or to whom such property may have been delivered\u201d. The defendant contended that the search under the \u201cany person present\u201d language of the warrant violated his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights in that the warrant lacked specificity since it did not describe the person of the defendant as the object of the search. The court, however, looked at both the affidavit and the search warrant and concluded that there was probable cause to believe that any person on the premises was involved in the illegal trafficking of heroin. In so holding the court found that the search under the \u201cany persons present\u201d language fell within the narrowly circumscribed range of searches which because of their peculiar facts are consistent with the Fourth Amendment. In reaching its decision the court found several factors particularly relevant:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b625-5\">. . . the premises or area to be searched are small, confined and private; the nature of the criminal activity is such that the participants (in general) constantly shift or change so that it is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>practically, impossible for the police to predict that any specific person or persons will be on the premises at any given time; and the items specifically described in the warrant as the target of the search are of a size or kind which renders them easily and likely to be concealed on the person. 348 N.E.2d at 107.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b626-5\">This Court finds the reasoning in <em>Commonwealth v. Smith </em>persuasive. The premise to be searched, the Pedro San Agust\u00edn residence, was confined and private. Secondly, the affidavit stated that traffic in illicit drugs continued both day and night, and that the informant advised the affiant that the activity was of a continuing nature. In this type of situation it is reasonable to assume that the participants are constantly shifting so it is practically impossible for the police to predict that any specific person or persons would be at the Pedro San Agust\u00edn residence at any given time. Additionally, the affidavit states that;</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b626-6\">. . . based on my experience and training, I am aware that useable quantities of controlled substances are quite small, and may readily be concealed on the person; That, in my experience, controlled substances are often found concealed upon the person of those individuals who are present on the premises where controlled substances may be found; That in my experience persons present on a premises where a warrant is being executed will often hide the controlled substance sought, or a portion thereof, on their person.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b626-7\">This Court is satisfied that relying on the particular facts in this case the warrant to search \u201cpersons present therein\u201d was based upon probable cause to believe that such person would be involved in heroin trafficking. The fact that one of the persons present did not actually possess narcotics is not determinative. A search under the \u201cpersons present therein\u201d language is valid where the underlying circumstances clearly demonstrate probable cause to believe that all persons are involved in the criminal activity. But this does not require that, judging by hindsight, every person on the premises was in fact involved in the criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>activity. Under the particular circumstances of this case, the Court finds that defendant\u2019s presence at the Pedro San Agustin residence satisfied the specificity requirements of \u00a7 35.20 (b) and the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b627-3\">For the aforementioned reasons, defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress is denied.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Flores also known as Francisco Lizama Flores.</p>\n    <p id=\"b233-3\">On June 10, 1971, the Court granted the appellant\u2019s petition for determination of heirship, establishing him as the son and heir of the decedent. Thereafter, the administrator on behalf of the appellant, filed a petition for partial distribution with the Island Court on October 20, 1971.</p>\n    <p id=\"b233-4\">The appellant seeks an interest in the Estate of Lorenzo Aflague Flores, deceased. He alleges in his statement of claim of interest in Estate dated March 5,1970, and in his petition for partial distribution dated October 20,1970, that he is the son of the decedent and therefore is entitled to receive Lot No. 154 Mapas, Sinajana, Guam in its entirety, since the decedent during his life time orally gave him the aforementioned lot. The said lot containing 1.6 hectares, is only a part of the Estate\u2019s asset along with Lot No. 593, containing 25 hectares in Chochogo.</p>\n    <p id=\"b233-5\">Furthermore, another issue was raised during the trial which merits our attention. It was whether the partial distribution would be injurious to the other heirs whose interest were opposed to the petitioner\u2019s. The heirs at law of said deceased, who may or may not be entitled to share in the balance of the Estate herein, are ANA FLORES GUERRERO, daughter, MARIA FLORES MENDIOLA, daughter, LORENZO RIVERA FLORES, son, DOLORES FLORES PABLO, daughter, JOSE RIVERA FLORES, son, and FRANCISCO LIZAMA FLORES (FRANK R. FLORES), son. At point here is Article I, Section 1001, of the Probate Code of Guam, which states in part:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b233-6\">\u201cIf at the hearing, it appears that the estate is but little indebted, and that the share of the applicant may be allowed to him without loss to the creditors or injury to the estate or any person interested therein, the Court shall make an order requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>the executor or administrator to deliver to the applicant the share of the estate to which he is entitled____\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b234-5\">The lower court believed that to grant partial distribution of Lot No. 154 to Francisco Lizama Flores would be injurious to the other heirs, since Lot No. 154 can readily be developed, has water and power, is next to a public road, and has some homes situated on it; while on the other hand, Lot No. 593 of the Estate is swampy, two miles away from the nearest public road, lacks water and power, and cannot be readily developed. Therefore, the lower court denied the petition of Flores and the petitioner herein appeals.</p>\n    <p id=\"b234-6\">Based on the factual situation in this case, the decision of the lower court is affirmed. The decedent having died on September 13, 1938, and leaving no will, distribution of the decedent\u2019s estate must follow the laws of succession. There is no provision in our Probate Code for an oral will. Distribution of the Estate must be in accordance with the laws of intestacy.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

He was charged with failure to file an income tax return for 1953. This was alleged to be in violation of Section 145(a), Internal Eevenue Code of 1939, 53 Stat. 62, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 145(a) (1945 Edition),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> made applicable to Guam by Section 31 of the Organic Act of Guam, 64 Stat. 392, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421i.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The action was brought before the Island Court of Guam. The charge was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n    <p id=\"b28-5\">The questioned soundness of this conclusion describes the issue upon this appeal. We hold the alleged violation to be of Guamanian law and to be of the type committed to the jurisdiction of the Island Court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b28-6\">Congress has the power to directly legislate local law for a territory. <em>National Bank v. County of Yankton, </em>101 U.S. 129 (1879). A statute of this character is to be distinguished from a law of general application throughout the United States. <em>Am. Security Co. v. Dist. of Columbia, </em>224 U.S. 491 <em>(1912); Ex Parte Krause, </em>228 Fed. 547 (D.C., W.D. Wash. 1915).</p>\n    <p id=\"b28-7\">An entire code of laws, including criminal provisions, may be adopted by reference. In so doing, it is not necessary to repeat the adopted code. <em>Engel v. Davenport, </em>271 U.S. 33 <em>(1926); Ex Parte Krause, </em>supra; <em>United States v. Davis, </em>71 F.Supp. 749 (D.D.C. 1947). If the reference is clear, the adopted code is to be applied in toto, unless there is an indication to the contrary in the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>of the enactment. Here, there is nothing in either the statute or its legislative history to suggest that Congress wished to adopt only part of the income tax laws of the United States for Guam. U.S. Code, Congressional Service, 81st Congress, Second Session 1950, Vol. 2, p. 2856. Any other conclusion would arbitrarily destroy the effectiveness of Section 31.</p>\n    <p id=\"b29-3\">Section 31 of the Organic Act of Guam made the Internal Revenue Code of the United States a territorial tax law of Guam, to be enforced by Guamanian officials. <em>Laguana v. Ansell, </em>102 F.Supp. 919 (D. Guam 1952), aff\u2019d per curiam, 212 F.2d 207 (9 Cir. 1954), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 830 <em>(1954); </em>accord, <em>Binns v. United States, </em>194 U.S. 486, 492 (1904).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Violations of Guamanian law are to be, indeed can only be, prosecuted in the appropriate courts of the Territory. <em>United States v. Pridgeon, </em>153 U.S. 48 (1894); <em>Ex Parte Krause, supra; United States v. Wright, </em>15 F.R.D. 184 (D. Hawaii, 1954).</p>\n    <p id=\"b29-4\">Respondent cites <em>Government of Guam v. Kaanehe, </em>124 F.Supp. 15 (D. Guam 1954), as contrary authority. It is not. All the court held there was that a violation of the income tax laws must be punished exclusively as provided in those laws, and not by reference to other criminal statutes. The question of whether the United States or the Government of Guam should enforce the tax provision was neither involved nor decided.</p>\n    <p id=\"b29-5\">The Island Court of Guam has jurisdiction of a misdemeanor defined by territorial law. Code of Civil Procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>of Guam Section 82.1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We see no conflict with Section 82.4.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It refers to civil cases, not criminal cases.

Defendant\u2019s motion is based on the lack of competent evidence to establish three essential elements: (1) the identity of the murder victim; (2) the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s statement; and (3) compliance with procedural safeguards under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436.</p>\n    <p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>In the past this Court was reluctant to dismiss an indictment on the ground of insufficient evidence before the grand jury. <em>See People v. Viloria, </em>S.C. Criminal Case No. 324F-77; <em>United States v. Costello, </em>350 U.S. 359, 76 S.Ct. 406 (1956). Prior to January 1, 1978, indictments were handed down pursuant to Rules 6 and 7 of the old Guam Rules of Criminal Procedure. Now, however, indictments are measured by the standards set forth in Chapter 50 of the new Rules of Criminal Procedure (Public Law 13-186).</p>\n    <p id=\"b566-5\">Section 50.42 of the new Code reads:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b566-6\">The grand jury shall receive only evidence which would be admissible over objection at the trial of a criminal action but the fact that evidence which would have been excluded at trial was received by the grand jury does not render the indictment void where sufficient competent evidence to support the indictment was received by the grand jury.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b566-7\">Whereas under the old rules virtually <em>any </em>evidence would support an indictment, \u00a7 50.42 specifies that the grand jury may consider only competent evidence which would be admissible over objection at trial.</p>\n    <p id=\"b566-8\">The indictment handed down against De Jesus was based entirely on a statement given police officers by the defendant. A confession is not admissible into evidence at trial absent the introduction of a proper foundation of voluntariness.</p>\n    <p id=\"b566-9\">California Penal Code \u00a7 939.6 is similar to \u00a7 50.42 in that it requires an indictment to be based upon admissible evidence. In <em>Mott v. Superior Court, </em>226 Cal.App.2d 617, 38 Cal. Rptr. 247 (1964), the court dismissed an indictment based upon a confession where the grand jury received no preliminary foundation of voluntariness. As. stated at page 618:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b566-10\">A grand jury may receive only the same type of evidence which a. court of law may entertain, i.e., legally competent evidence. Hence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>a foundation of voluntariness must be established. None having been laid here, there was no competent or sufficient evidence to support the indictment.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b567-3\">Defendant here maintains that the foundation laid before the grand jury was insufficient to support admission of the confession. The only foundation appeared on page 4 of the grand jury transcript:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b567-4\">Q Prior to the interview with him did you advise him of his constitutional rights?</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b567-5\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b567-6\">Q Did you make any promises to him or did you use any force to obtain a statement?</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b567-7\">A No, sir.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b567-8\">This was the only evidence of voluntariness to be found in the transcript. At least one grand juror had doubts whether the confession was voluntary.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b567-9\">Q How did you get De Jesus\u2019 statement?</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b567-10\">A I don\u2019t think that would be appropriate under the circumstances. Transcript page 16.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b567-11\">This Court is of the opinion that it was appropriate under the circumstances. The grand jury should have received more than cursory, conclusory statements as to the facts surrounding De Jesus\u2019 confession. This Court does not hold that the same technical foundation for admission of evidence at trial is required to be put before the grand jury. See <em>People v. Olf, </em>195 Cal.App.2d 97, 104, 15 Cal. Rptr. 390 (1961). It is held only that the foundation laid here was insufficient to support the indictment.</p>\n    <p id=\"ATB\">Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the Indictment is granted.</p>\n    <p id=\"b567-12\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

GUAM AIRPORT AUTHORITY and AIR HAWAII INTERNATIONAL, INC., d/b/a American International Rent-A-Car and Budget Rent-A-Car, Defendants</parties>\n  <docketnumber id=\"b656-10\">Civil Case No. 836-78</docketnumber>\n  <court id=\"AGu0\">Superior Court of Guam</court>\n  <decisiondate id=\"b656-11\">May 24, 1979</decisiondate>\n  <opinion type=\"majority\">\n    <author id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>ABBATE, <em>Presiding Judge</em></author>\n    <p id=\"b657-5\">DECISION AND ORDER</p>\n    <p id=\"b657-6\">This suit in equity for a declaratory judgment came on for trial without a jury before the above-entitled Court on May 3, 1979. J. Bradley Klemm appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, Matthew C. Gruskin appeared on behalf of the defendant Air Hawaii, Inc. and Lawrence J. Teker appeared on behalf of defendant Guam Airport Authority. The matter was heard before the Honorable Paul J. Abbate and decision was reserved.</p>\n    <p id=\"b657-7\">At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s evidence, defendant Air Hawaii\u2019s attorney moved to dismiss on the ground that on the facts and the law the plaintiff had shown no right to relief. Air Hawaii\u2019s first contention in support of this motion may be taken as jurisdictional: that the subject of this action for a declaratory judgment is the decision of a government agency, reviewable only for accordance with law or substantial evidence to support it (Govt. Code \u00a7 24140), and upon a petition filed within thirty (30) days of the last day for reconsideration of the decision (Govt. Code \u00a7 24141), which would be thirty (30) days after mailing of the decision (Govt. Code \u00a7 24135). In this case, the Guam Airport Authority made its decision on September 7, 1978, and the statutory 60-day period would run out prior to the November 17 filing of this lawsuit.</p>\n    <p id=\"b657-8\">The action of Guam Airport Authority did not purport to be a contested case decision following an agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>hearing (Govt. Code \u00a7 24100 et seq.); but rather was described as a meeting under \u00a7 11.02(c) of the lease agreement with each licensee: \u201cresolution of disputes, disagreement, conflicts.\u201d The fact that a decision under this clause was reached by Mr. Tuncap, the Airport Manager, after a meeting which might be characterized as an informal hearing does not convert it into a \u00a7 24100 contested case hearing, reviewable only under \u00a7 24140.</p>\n    <p id=\"b658-5\">Defendant Air Hawaii\u2019s second contention on its motion is that the plaintiff failed, as a prerequisite to a declaratory judgment action, to exhaust administrative remedies. The record shows that prior to the filing of this action, plaintiff\u2019s attorney requested of defendant Guam Airport Authority\u2019s attorney, pursuant to Government Code \u00a7 24207, the rules for a declaratory ruling by the agency. More than six (6) weeks later plaintiff\u2019s attorney received from Mr. Tuncap the reply that the Guam Airport Authority had not promulgated such rules, as the statute requires. The rule that a party must exhaust administrative remedies prior to seeking relief in the courts is not applicable if the administrative remedy is unavailable. <em>(Martino v. Concord Community Hospital District, </em>233 C.A.2d 51 (1965)).</p>\n    <p id=\"b658-6\">Defendant\u2019s third ground for its motion was that upon the facts the plaintiff had not shown a right to relief. On this ground, the Court declines to make any judgment on the merits against the plaintiff.</p>\n    <p id=\"b658-7\">The Motion to Dismiss is therefore DENIED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b658-8\">After due consideration of all testimony and evidence presented at trial, this Court makes the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law:</p>\n    <p id=\"b658-9\">FINDINGS OF FACT</p>\n    <p id=\"b658-10\">1. In 1978 the Guam Airport Authority advertised for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>bids on four car rental concessions to be located at the Guam International Air Terminal.</p>\n    <p id=\"b659-3\">2. In order to bid, it was necessary to complete a \u201cPreQualification\u201d form. Bruce McKenzie signed a pre-qualification form as representative of \u201cAmerican International Rent-A-Car\u201d. There was no place on the form for denomination of a fictitious, trade or assumed business name, and the form did not by its terms require such a listing. American International Rent-A-Car is an assumed business name of Air Hawaii International, Inc.</p>\n    <p id=\"b659-4\">3. Five pre-qualified bidders made bids for lease concessions at the Airport. One of the successful bidders was Guam Rent-A-Car. Another successful bid was made by Bruce McKenzie as representative of \u201cAir Hawaii International, Inc., d/b/a American International Rent-A-Car\u201d. The bid form had a space for \u201cCompany Name of Bidder\u201d, but had no required space to fill in a fictitious, trade or assumed business name. The bids were secret, and Guam Airport Authority gave out no information regarding names or trade names of prospective bidders.</p>\n    <p id=\"b659-5\">4. There were four successful bidders, who signed similar lease contracts with the Guam Airport Authority. One was the plaintiff, whose agent D. L. Karsten signed as representative for \u201cGuam Rent-A-Car, d/b/a Avis Rent-A-Car\u201d. Another was defendant Air Hawaii, whose agent Bruce McKenzie signed as representative of \u201cAir Hawaii International, Inc., d/b/a American International Rent-A-Car\u201d. There was no space on the bid form provided for a fictitious, trade or \u201cdoing business as\u201d name, and this information was not required.</p>\n    <p id=\"b659-6\">5. Subsequent to its signing of the lease agreement with Guam Airport Authority, Air Hawaii rented cars at the Air Terminal in the name of American International Rent-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>A-Car with rental agreements, rate cards and appropriate signs giving notice of this. There is no objection to this.</p>\n    <p id=\"b660-5\">6. Defendant Air Hawaii sought to change its trade name to Budget Rent-A-Car, as it had made arrangements to use that trade name in Guam. Plaintiff objected to Air Hawaii carrying on activities at the Air Terminal in the name of Budget Rent-A-Car such as answering the telephone with that name, using car rental agreements in the name of Budget, posting Budget signs and rate cards, and advertising Budget\u2019s place of business as at the Air Terminal.</p>\n    <p id=\"b660-6\">7. As a result of plaintiff\u2019s objections, a meeting was held at the Guam Airport Authority Office. The decision of Director David Tuncap is contained in the Authority\u2019s letter of September 7, 1978, denying Air Hawaii the right to change its trade name to Budget, but permitting all lessees the right to post not more than two 12-inch by 18-inch signs announcing that the lessee was agent for any additional rent-a-car company. Air Hawaii was specifically authorized in writing to display \u201cagent for\u201d Budget signs, National was allowed to display \u201cagent for\u201d GSA and Pan Am Rent-A-Car, Hertz could display \u201cagent for\u201d Nippon Rent-A-Car, and Guam Rent-A-Car, d/b/a Avis does not appear to have requested \u201cagent for\u201d designations.</p>\n    <p id=\"b660-7\">8. The lease agreement does not impose any restriction on the lessees in the use of a trade name or assumed business name, and as noted, supra, does not even require the listing of this information. Section 34 of the lease contract states that \u201call duties, obligations and liabilities of Guam Airport Authority and Company with respect to the leased premises are expressly set forth herein\u201d. The contract does not give Guam Airport Authority the power to regulate the use of otherwise proper trade or assumed business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>names, or to restrict the lessee to using a trade name which was affixed to the contract as a d/b/a by the lessee, as long as the original lessee continues in fact as the company operating the concession.</p>\n    <p id=\"b661-3\">9. The contract signed by each lessee did not expressly limit the number of rental car leases at Guam International Airport to four, but appendix A to the contract was made a part of the agreement and showed four rental booths. The pre-qualification form and bid forms were not made a part of the contract. The Court finds that it was the intent of each lease to give one of only four car rental booths to each lessee under these agreements.</p>\n    <p id=\"b661-4\">10. The Court further finds that there have been only four companies and four booths operating as rental-car concessions at Guam International Airport, and that Air Hawaii\u2019s attempt to change its trade name or any car company displaying an \u201cagent for\u201d sign does not constitute the grant of the right to operate a rental-car concession in excess of the four allowed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b661-5\">11. The lease contract contains a limitation in Section 16 upon selling, assigning, transferring or subleasing by the company without the consent of Guam Airport Authority. The Court finds that the attempt of Air Hawaii to change its trade name does not constitute a sale, assignment, transfer or sublet of any rights under the contract, and that Air Hawaii has been and remains the proprietor of the booth originally leased by Air Hawaii.</p>\n    <p id=\"b661-6\">12. Section 3.01 of the lease agreement states that Guam Airport Authority shall not grant terms or conditions more favorable than those of the lessee to any other party. The decision of Guam Airport Authority to allow two \u201cagent for\u201d signs to each lessee under their power to control the appearance of the booths and prevent confusion to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>public does not constitute a grant of more favorable conditions to any lessee than those accorded plaintiff Guam Rent-A-Car, being equally applicable to all lessees.</p>\n    <p id=\"b662-5\">13. The lease agreement does not limit the number of trade names which may be displayed by each lessor company, except as may be proper under Guam Airport Authority\u2019s power to control the. appearance of the car rental area and prevent confusion to the public.</p>\n    <p id=\"b662-6\">14. Plaintiff Guam Rent-A-Car did not prove that reduction in their gross revenues was due to any action of Air Hawaii, Inc., or Guam Airport Authority.</p>\n    <p id=\"b662-7\">15. To the extent that any of the foregoing Findings of Fact constitute Conclusions of Law, they are to be so considered.</p>\n    <p id=\"b662-8\">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n    <p id=\"b662-9\">1. Defendant Air Hawaii, Inc. is operating at Guam International Airport under a valid lease agreement with the Guam Airport Authority.</p>\n    <p id=\"b662-10\">2. The lease agreement does not restrict defendant Air Hawaii\u2019s right to change its name to Budget Rent-A-Car, or to do business as Budget Rent-A-Car.</p>\n    <p id=\"b662-11\">3. Defendant Guam Airport Authority has not allowed Air Hawaii, Inc. to operate on conditions more favorable than other lessees, or outside of the terms of the lease agreement.</p>\n    <p id=\"b662-12\">4. Defendant Guam Airport Authority has not allowed an unauthorized car rental company to do business at Guam International Airport.</p>\n    <p id=\"b662-13\">5. Defendant Guam Airport Authority has not allowed more than four car rental companies to do business at Guam International Airport.</p>\n    <p id=\"b663-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>6. To the extent that any of these Conclusions of Law constitute Findings of Fact, they are to be considered as such.</p>\n    <p id=\"b663-3\">WHEREFORE, IT IS: ORDERED, DECREED AND DECLARED THAT the contract between Guam Airport Authority and Air Hawaii, Inc., entered into on June 1, 1978, is in full force and effect between the parties, and that this contract does not restrict Air Hawaii, Inc., from using the trade name or doing business as \u201cBudget Rent-A-Car\u201d.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The defendant attacked the diversity of the District Court of Guam, and on January 9, 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>trict Court of Guam did not have diversity jurisdiction. <em>Chase Manhattan Bank v. South Acres Development Company, </em>434 U.S. 236, 54 L.Ed.2d 501, 98 S.Ct. 544 (1978). Thereafter, on June 6, 1978, the plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed by the District Court of Guam. On January 4, 1979, the plaintiff initiated this action in the Superior Court of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b687-3\">Defendant moved this Court to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s action on the grounds that the action is barred by \u00a7 339 of the Civil Procedure Code of Guam, a two-year statute of limitation. Plaintiff asserts the equitable tolling doctrine as an exception to this defense. Defendant does not contest the applicability of the doctrine to Guam, but submits that plaintiff is precluded from asserting the doctrine because of its complete failure to proceed in a diligent manner.</p>\n    <p id=\"b687-4\">In <em>Addison v. California, </em>21 Cal.3d 314, 578 P.2d 141, 146 Cal. Rptr. 224 (1978), the Court stated:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b687-5\">As demonstrated by <em>Bollinger &amp; Elkino, </em>application of the doctrine of equitable tolling requires timely notice, and lack of prejudice to the defendant, and <em>reasonable and good faith conduct on the part of the plaintiff </em>(emphasis added). 21 Cal.3d at 319.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b687-6\">On May 24, 1979, defendant moved to take the deposition of Jack A. Rosenzweig and Daniel R. Del Priore, attorneys for plaintiff in this case. During their respective oral examination, certain questions propounded to each, respectively, were objected to on the grounds of work product rule. On July 26, 1979, defendant moved to compel discovery of these questions.</p>\n    <p id=\"b687-7\">Under Civil Procedure Rule 26(b) (3) and the doctrine enunciated in <em>Hickman v. Taylor, </em>329 U.S. 495, 511-512, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed 451 (1947), an attorney\u2019s work product is discoverable upon a showing of substantial need by the moving party and an inability to obtain its equivalent by other means, <em>Bird v. Penn Central Co., </em>61 F.R.D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>43, 47 (1973). Furthermore, Rule 26(b) (3) does not create an absolute immunity from discovery for opinion work product, barring disclosure of such material under any circumstances. <em>Hangards, Inc. v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>413 F.Supp. 926, 931 (1976).</p>\n    <p id=\"b688-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s assertion of the equitable tolling doctrine raises the issues of good faith and diligence in re-filing this suit. Since this doctrine is an exception to the statutes of limitations, it is incumbent upon plaintiff to show good faith and diligence. Defendant can demonstrate the contrary only through discovery of information in the hands of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys. Therefore, such information being directly at issue, and the need for production is compelling, the discovery sought by defendant should be permitted as modified and to the extent it does not involve the violation of attorney-client privilege.</p>\n    <p id=\"b688-6\">It is the decision of this Court that certain questions, propounded at the oral examination of Jack A. Rosenzweig and Daniel Del Priore, respectively, as modified, be answered in writing, <em>Keogh v. Pearson, </em>35 F.R.D. 20 (D.C.D.C. 1964).</p>\n    <p id=\"b688-7\">Questions propounded to Jack A. Rosenzweig</p>\n    <p id=\"b688-8\">1. Page 4, lines 1 to 4. What did you do about the claim which is pending in this particular action and also was then pending in the District Court? How did you proceed to prosecute that claim after learning about the decision of the Supreme Court, if anything?</p>\n    <p id=\"b688-9\">2. Page 9, lines 12 to 14. Why, if there is any reason, did you not re-file this claim in the Superior Court right after learning about the U.S. Supreme Court decision?</p>\n    <p id=\"b688-10\">3. Page 9, lines 18 to 20. Why after learning of the District Court\u2019s dismissal on June 26, 1979, did you not im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>mediately or just as quickly as you could re-file the claim in the Superior Court of Guam?</p>\n    <p id=\"b689-3\">4.Page 10, lines 11 to 15. So apparently, of course, you did not file right after the Supreme Court decision nor did you file right after the District Court decision. And your decision not to re-file right away was a professional decision that you made sufficient to yourself; is that right?</p>\n    <p id=\"b689-4\">5.Page 11, lines 7 to 12. Isn\u2019t it true, Mr. Rosenzweig, that at least one major reason that this action was not re-filed right after the Supreme Court decision and, furthermore, not re-filed right after the District Court dismissal was that your office at least was to a certain extent understaffed and unable to get around to this case until Mr. Del Priore joined your firm?</p>\n    <p id=\"b689-5\">6. Page 12, lines 5 to 8. What other things, if any, were done besides wait this one year and file in January of 1979, and to keep an eye on this legislation, what other things other than those things were done to proceed with the prosecution of this action?</p>\n    <p id=\"b689-6\">7. Page 12, lines 20 to 23. Is it your contention that waiting for the period between the timeyou learned about the Supreme Court decision until the time you actually filed in January 1979 that plaintiff proceeded at all times in a diligent manner?</p>\n    <p id=\"b689-7\">Questions propounded to Mr. Del Priore</p>\n    <p id=\"b689-8\">1. Page 4, lines 10 to 12. Were you told anything about how soon the case should be re-filed or whether there\u2019s any emergency or whether there\u2019s any hurry in re-filing it?</p>\n    <p id=\"b689-9\">2. Page 7, lines 8 to 9. Have you ever discussed the filing of this case as late as it has been with Mr. Rosenzweig?</p>\n    <p id=\"b689-10\">3. Page 10, lines 5 to 9. And on behalf of the plaintiff, you say that you are standing on the equitable tolling doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>trine which has to do, at least in one aspect, with proceeding at all times diligently and, on the other hand, refusing to answer that question; is that right?</p>\n    <p id=\"b690-5\">Based on the foregoing authorities, IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n    <p id=\"b690-6\">1.

Benavente and Juan R. Babauta, hereinafter the defendants, were convicted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>the Island Court of petty theft. The defendants allege that they were prejudiced by the failure to file an information within a reasonable time and that an alleged confession was received when the defendant had not been warned of his right to remain silent. We are unable to pass on the evidence as a whole because the transcript of testimony ordered by the defendants was limited to the cross-examination of the defendant, Babauta, and the testimony of the arresting officer.</p>\n    <p id=\"Ag3Z\">Insofar as we are advised, a full transcript would have shown the guilt of the defendants, independent of any alleged confession. The evidence available to us shows that the arresting officer was engaged in patrolling an area by automobile when his attention was directed to the defendants in the early morning hours. When he made inquiry he was told that the defendants were waiting for girls. He noticed bicycles and made inquiry as to where the bicycles came from and was told that a bicycle outside the car had been seen by them earlier and they came back to pick it up. He then asked what the second bicycle was doing inside the car and they stated that they found that bicycle at the same spot. Benavente then asked whether the officer was going to report the matter, and when he inquired where Benavente had got the bicycle, Benavente pointed to the direction of an apartment building. At this point the officer called police headquarters to ask for a detective.

The government of Guam and Guam Memorial Hospital were the named defendants in this action (while another action was commenced against the operating physician in the District Court of Guam). Two separate trials were held because the Superior Court of Guam has exclusive jurisdiction against the government of Guam under the Government Claims Act (which does not provide for jury trials).</p>\n    <p id=\"b473-9\">FACTS</p>\n    <p id=\"b473-10\">Judith A. Schenk, a teacher working in Truk, came to Guam in early August of 1973 for the purpose of obtaining a therapeutic abortion. After several inquiries, Mrs. Schenk approached Dr. Vivian Batoyan, who agreed to do the operation after a psychiatrist concluded that an abortion was essential and that sterilization was to be recommended. Dr. Batoyan performed the operation on the evening of August 17,1973, at the Guam Memorial Hospital. Dr. Batoyan was a private physician and not an employee of the hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>but she had hospital privileges (her qualification had been reviewed by a hospital committee and she was board eligible).</p>\n    <p id=\"b474-5\">Unfortunately due to improper diagnosis Dr. Batoyan failed to remove all parts of the fetus during the operation and these parts continued to grow. Four months later another operation was required and a hysterectomy had to be performed because of excessive bleeding during surgery.</p>\n    <p id=\"b474-6\">Assisting Dr. Batoyan during the August 17 operation was a nurse, an employee of the hospital. Plaintiff bases her cause of action under a theory of respondeat superior and also a theory that the hospital itself failed in a duty to make certain that Dr. Batoyan had correctly performed the abortion.</p>\n    <p id=\"b474-7\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n    <p id=\"b474-8\">Appellant offers two appealable issues:</p>\n    <p id=\"b474-9\">1. Was the Guam Memorial Hospital negligent as a matter of law?</p>\n    <p id=\"b474-10\">2. Were awarded damages excessive ?</p>\n    <p id=\"b474-11\">NEGLIGENCE OF GUAM MEMORIAL HOSPITAL</p>\n    <p id=\"b474-12\">In order for the hospital to be liable, there had to be evidence at trial to suggest either (1) that under a theory of respondeat superior the hospital was vicariously liable for the negligent acts of one of its employees or (2) that the hospital independently owed a direct legal duty to supervise the operation and to provide for effective clinical review after surgery. The court finds that no such evidence was adduced at trial and that the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b474-13\">1. <em>The question of the hospital\u2019s vicarious liability under a respondeat superior theory.</em></p>\n    <p id=\"b474-15\">Clearly, Dr. Batoyan was not an employee of the hospital although she had hospital privileges. Therefore, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>order for Guam Memorial Hospital to be liable under respondeat superior evidence must have been offered to show that either the assisting nurse or the pathologist (both hospital employees) was somehow negligent and had a duty to determine whether all fetal parts were properly removed from the patient. No such evidence was offered at trial by the plaintiff, while the defense offered extensive testimony that a nurse and a pathologist are under no duty to make such clinical and medical evaluations.</p>\n    <p id=\"b475-3\">At pages 267-68 of the transcript, Nellie Tinsey, head nurse of the GMH operating room, testified that it was not the duty of the operating room nurse to determine if all parts of the fetus had been removed. Brihidia C. Aguigui, the director of nursing service, testified to the same effect, stating that the operating nurse\u2019s only duty was to make sure that all fetal material removed from the uterus was placed in a receptacle and delivered to the pathological laboratory. (Transcript, pages 270-271.) Finally, Dr. Yergilio Lopez (a qualified D &amp; C [Dilatation and Curettage] surgeon, as stipulated by both parties) testified as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b475-4\">In a D &amp; C operation, it is not the function of the operating room nurse to determine if all fetal parts have been removed (Transcript, page 295. See also testimony at pages 256 and 332).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b475-5\">Plaintiff offered no contrary evidence to suggest that the operating room nurse had a duty to make certain that all fetal parts had been removed, and the court finds that under these facts the nurse only had a duty to make certain that all fetal parts were properly delivered to the pathologist and that this duty was properly performed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b475-6\">In addition, plaintiff has argued that by requiring more clinical history from the surgeon, the pathologist might have realized that a fetus was still present and growing within the patient. However, no evidence or legal authority was offered to suggest that the pathologist had a duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>make such a clinical evaluation and question Dr. Batoyan\u2019s diagnosis of incomplete abortion. According to expert testimony, a pathologist is only responsible for examining and correctly identifying samples sent to him from surgery. (Transcript, pages 295-96, 54:10, 58:11, 91:3, 368-369.) It is true, however, that a pathologist <em>may, </em>if he wishes, request additional clinical history from the physician in charge (transcript, page 59:19), but no evidence was offered to suggest that the pathologist should have been aware of any irregularity in this instance. He was provided with a sample from the D &amp; C operation and his function was to identify this sample. Dr. Leung Chen testified that a 15 cc sample was consistent with an eight-week pregnancy diagnosed as an incomplete abortion. (Transcript, pages 316-18.)</p>\n    <p id=\"b476-3\">Plaintiff doesn\u2019t really suggest what additional clinical information the pathologist should have requested, except to suggest that if the abortion had been properly diagnosed as therapeutic (i.e. induced), the pathologist would have become concerned and contacted the surgeon. (Transcript, page 262:8.) However, the pathologist had no reason to doubt Dr. Batoyan\u2019s diagnosis of incomplete abortion and there is nothing in the record to suggest that if he had asked for more clinical information she would have changed this diagnosis to one of therapeutic abortion. Even Dr. Hobson, the plaintiff\u2019s expert witness, admits that the pathologist\u2019s report was consistent with the surgeon\u2019s diagnosis supplied to him (transcript, pages 261:22-262:5) and that it is not the function of the pathologist to determine whether all parts of the fetus have been removed unless \u201cinformation is given to him to make this part of his report.\u201d (Transcript, pages 256:8-257:1.) Finally, it should be pointed out that even in instances of a therapeutic abortion, there are many cases where the fetus does not develop at all and the absence of a fetus would not neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>sarily be cause for alarm. (Transcript, pages 334:20-335:4; see also, pages 365, 310:15.)</p>\n    <p id=\"b477-3\">Testimony established that the operation was under the sole control of the surgeon, Dr. Batoyan. Plaintiff has offered nothing to suggest that the pathologist should have been aware of any irregularity and should have requested additional information. The pathologist had a duty to correctly identify the sample delivered to him; this he did accurately and there are no facts (or legal authority offered) to suggest that he was negligent in failing to ask Dr. Batoyan for more information. If we are to accept plaintiff\u2019s arguments, a pathologist would always be required to request the patient\u2019s entire clinical history and spend the better part of his day double-checking the surgeon and offering his own independent diagnosis. Patently, this is not the function of the pathologist; uncontradicted testimony has stated that his main responsibility is to correctly identify tissues and organs and not to make clinical diagnoses.</p>\n    <p id=\"b477-4\">2. <em>The hospital\u2019s independent duty to review the surgeon\u2019s diagnosis and operating procedures.</em></p>\n    <p id=\"b477-6\">Plaintiff has offered into evidence medical manuals having to do with accreditation of hospitals, the American Medical Association guides to ethics and the by-laws of Guam Memorial Hospital. While these manuals perhaps provide a useful framework in determining standards of negligence, it must be pointed out that these manuals do not set up a legal rule establishing liability such as provided in a legal decision. These manuals are proposed ideal standards as to accreditation and recognized procedures and it should not be supposed that a violation of one of these standards will result in a strict or absolute liability for a hospital. Unfortunately, the trial judge seems to have accepted these standards as legal authority when he states as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>In seeking the standard of care that is to be exercised by the hospital, this court has been aided by an expert witness, Dr. G. C. Hob-son, the By-Laws of the Medical Staff of the Guam Memorial Hospital, and the Accreditation Manual for Hospitals, up-dated 1973 (Exhibits B and C).</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b478-5\">It is crystal clear that compliance with the By-Laws and the Manual for Hospital Accreditation was ignored during the confinement of this patient. There was no clinical history sent with the tissue to the pathologist. The pathologist made no inquiry after finding no fetal parts. No medical Review Committee was in existence to review medical records. No Tissue Committee to review surgical procedure. The hospital records indicated Incomplete Abortion as an admitting and final diagnosis. The psychiatrist, Dr. David Kennedy, recommended Therapeutic Abortion.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b478-6\">It is true as the trial court has stated above, that the defendant hospital failed to follow certain recommended procedures for surgical review as set forth by the Accreditation Manual for Hospitals and its by-laws (although testimony at page 363 of the transcript shows that certain surgical review was provided for on a random basis). However, before attempting to prove which standards of conduct the hospital should be held to, it is incumbent that the plaintiff cite authority showing that a hospital owes a duty to supervise and review the surgery of a <em>private </em>physician who has used hospital facilities to treat his or her patient. Plaintiff has offered no authority indicating that a hospital has ever been found liable under the facts alleged in her complaint (and argued in her legal memoranda), and the court has similarly been unable to find such authority.</p>\n    <p id=\"b478-7\">None of the cases supporting the trial court\u2019s decision hold that a hospital owes such a duty to review a private physician\u2019s diagnoses and surgery even though hospital facilities have been used to operate. In <em>Bing v. Thunig, 2 </em>N.Y.2d 656, 143 N.E.2d 3, liability was based entirely on a respondeat superior theory (where one of the hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>employees was proved negligent \u2014 unlike the case here on appeal). <em>Hendrickson v. Hadkin, </em>294 N.Y.S. 982, 983 (1937), is inapposite and even supports the position of the hospital because the court found it reversible error to instruct a jury that in determining liability they could consider the fact that a hospital failed to review a private physician\u2019s treatment for cancer:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b479-3\">Assuming the hospital was under a duty to exercise such care, the scope of such duty did not extend to the professional treatment administered by plaintiff\u2019s own doctors, whether they were licensed or not. The respects in which it is claimed the hospital was derelict all pertain to such professional treatment, with which appellant had no right to interfere. Further assuming the appellant in the respects mentioned was negligent, such negligence must be attributed to its doctors and nurses. The rule is now well settled that a hospital, whether charitable or private, is immune from liability to patients by reason of negligence of its doctors and nurses with respect to any matter relating to the patient\u2019s medical care and attention. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b479-4\">Finally, the trial court cites <em>Darling v. Charlestown Community Memorial Hospital, </em>211 N.E.2d 253, 14 A.L.R.3d 860 (1965), in support of its decision. However, again in this case, liability was based at least partially on respondeat superior because the negligent nurses and surgeon were all employees of the hospital. It is true that in 14 A.L.R.3d at page 879, the commentators do suggest that <em>Darling </em>might represent a new theory of independent negligence against hospitals:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b479-5\">Even in the absence of an employer-employee or principal-agent relationship between the negligent doctor and the hospital, there now appears to be some chance, in view of the decision in <em>Darling v. Charlestown Community Memorial Hospital </em>(1965), 33 Ill.2d 326, 211 N.E.2d 253, 14 A.L.R.3d 860, infra \u00a7 3, cert. den. 383 U.S. 946, 16 L.Ed.2d 209, 86 S.Ct. 1204, to impose liability on the hospital on the theory of independent negligence in failing to review, super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>vise, or consult about, the treatment given by the physician directly in charge, if the situation indicates that the hospital had the opportunity for such review but failed to exercise it, or that its servants (usually nurses or residents) were negligent in failing to call the \u25a0attention of the proper hospital authorities to the impropriety or inadequacy of the treatment being given.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b480-5\">However, it is unclear on what facts the jury found liability in <em>Darling </em>and the court\u2019s language suggesting a broadened basis for liability was taken from <em>Bing v. Thunig, </em>supra, which dealt with the issue of vicarious liability and not independent negligence in failing to supervise physicians.</p>\n    <p id=\"b480-6\">Also, <em>Darling </em>has been interpreted in <em>Collins v. Westlake Community Hospital, </em>299 N.E.2d 326, 329 (1973), to be applied rather narrowly on its facts:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b480-7\">The evidence in <em>Darling </em>showed not only grossly improper medical treatment by the attending physician, but also a continuing and total failure by the hospital staff to recognize, report and react to a multitude of glaringly obvious signals indicating either the existence of a condition in the patient upon which the employed treatment had no effect, or grossly improper medical treatment by the attending physician.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b480-8\">In the instant case, unlike in <em>Darling, </em>there was no evidence to suggest that Dr. Batoyan was not qualified to perform surgery or that the hospital staff was somehow negligent (in failing to determine whether the fetus was still present within the patient). Also, the court in <em>Collins, </em>supra, stresses the fact that the <em>Darling </em>case concerned a negligent surgeon who not only was an employee of the hospital but had been placed on emergency call by the hospital when he was unqualified to do orthopedic surgery. The case here is also distinguishable because evidence suggested that an actual review of Dr. Batoyan\u2019s surgery would not have revealed any irregularity since there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>no obvious or gross signs that Dr. Batoyan had erred in her diagnosis. (Transcript, pages 310-15.)</p>\n    <p id=\"b481-3\">Finally, the plaintiff does not explain how the court can ignore such cases as <em>Haven v. Randolph, </em>342 F.Supp. 538 (D.C. D.C. 1972) (cited by defendant), which states that \u201c[a] hospital is liable for the acts of a physician only if he is employed by the hospital and/or acts as agent for the hospital [citing cases].\u201d (342 F.Supp. at 542; aff\u2019d 494 F.2d 1069 (D.C. Cir. 1974).) If the court were to accept Dr. Hobson\u2019s testimony that the hospital was negligent in failing to completely follow the Accreditation Manual standards for surgical review, we would have to hold that a hospital must review every one of the several hundred cases it handles monthly and that any deviation from the manual will result in absolute liability. While the trial court\u2019s findings are to be afforded great deference, there simply is not sufficient evidence or legal authority to suggest that the hospital could be independently negligent in failing to review an operation under the control of a private physician, which from all indications appeared to have been successful.</p>\n    <p id=\"b481-4\">DAMAGES</p>\n    <p id=\"b481-5\">The court\u2019s determination on appeal that the defendant hospital was not negligent as a matter of law and fact has rendered the question of excessive damages moot.

We must remand the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>to the trial court for this purpose as it is evident that there is no description at the present time, in the absence of survey, which describes the land to be conveyed and which the appellant could be required to convey.</p>\n    <p id=\"b43-3\">The appellant offered no evidence.

The trial court held that since secondary evidence could be received as to the contents of the deed, no extraordinary remedy was indicated and set the case for trial on the issue of specific performance. It appeared that the appellees took possession of the land in 1947 and constructed part of a house; that about four years later they constructed another house; that the appellant may not have owned the land but obtained title in 1951 after which the portion in question was conveyed to the appellees for consideration.

This appeal was taken from an order of the Island Court dismissing the appeal in that Court, which this Court treats as a final order requiring the administratrix to execute a deed of conveyance of the land in question to the appellee. In view of the facts in the case, we do not believe that the appellantadministratrix is entitled to delay a determination further.</p>\n    <p id=\"b77-3\">The appellant is the administratrix of the estate of her deceased mother. The appellee filed a petition in the Island Court, dated July 9, 1954, in which he alleged that he had purchased certain real property from Dolores Flores Pablo, and a deed was executed. The administratrix, through counsel, answered August 5, 1954, and alleged that any agreement was contrary to the statute of frauds and that the statute of limitations had run. The Court took evidence and entered its decision September 17, 1954, in which it held that a deed of sale had been executed in 1939 to the land and that the appellee took possession of the land and built a residence thereon; that the deed was not recorded at the request of the deceased grantor because of an existing mortgage on the land involved herein and other land; that the administratrix had subsequently requested an attorney to prepare a deed but had refused to execute it. The Court directed a judgment that the administratrix should execute a deed of conveyance.</p>\n    <p id=\"b77-4\">From this judgment the administratrix noticed an appeal September 24, 1954. The appeal was never docketed, and the appellant moved this Court to dismiss it under date of May 19, 1955. Before this motion was set for hearing and under date of June 2, 1955, the parties stipulated that the files should be returned to the Island Court for further proceedings. This Court, acting through its presiding judge, ordered, under date of June 3, 1955, \u201cthat the files and records in the above-entitled action shall be referred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>the Island Court of Guam for such further proceedings as the Court may find necessary or desirable.\u201d</p>\n    <p id=\"b78-3\">Counsel were notified by the Island Court under date of June 22, 1955 that the files had been returned and that a conference would be held July 5, 1955 at 1:30 p.m. Under date of December 5, 1955 the appellee moved to dismiss the appeal in the Island Court. A similar motion was filed October 9, 1956, but this was not set for hearing until January 31, 1958. Under date of October 6, 1958 the Island Court entered an order dismissing the appeal for unreasonable delay. This was followed by an ex parte motion filed March 24, 1959 to require the administratrix to execute a deed and a concurrent order of the same date. The administratrix did not comply, but under date of April 3, 1959, the administratrix, having changed counsel, moved this Court to order the suspension of proceedings in the Island Court pending further orders of this Court. The case was not docketed at the time, and under date of September 28, 1960, the clerk of this Court notified counsel that if the appeal was docketed the Court would hear the matter November 19, 1960; that all briefs and reply briefs must be filed not later than ten days before the date of hearing. The minutes in this Court show the entry of an order September 30, 1959 for the continuance of the appeal until a transcript was furnished; that on June 30, 1960, the case was continued to allow appellant to perfect her appeal and arguments were heard November 19, 1960.</p>\n    <p id=\"b78-4\">This case is a striking example of the evils of delay, for which this Court must accept its fair share of responsibility. At the time the original petition was filed in 1954, the Court below conducted an extensive hearing. That Court was confronted with the task of trying to determine what happened in 1939 at a time when land had a very limited value, but the economy of Guam was quite different as well. A consideration which might strike us today as being triv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>ial was not so considered in 1939. Correspondingly, education was neither so available nor so necessary. Guamanians did many informal things based upon faith in the integrity of their fellows which were not recorded. In its efforts to arrive at the truth, the trial court may have admitted evidence without objection which might not have been admissible if objected to, but the trial court concluded that the appellee had paid a valid consideration for the land, had built his residence there; had obtained a contract of purchase or a deed and had lost it. The certificate of guaranteed claim issued by the Naval Governor of Guam covering this land showed that the land was subject to a small mortgage. It would be reasonable to assume, as the trial court did, that the deceased owner requested that any instrument not be placed of record at that time. The trial court was peculiarly in a position to understand the condition prevailing then and to grasp the import of the testimony in the light of the tremendous subsequent increase in land values. The administratrix knew in September 1954 that she should execute a deed to implement the Court\u2019s decree. She noted an appeal but did not perfect it. When this Court entered its order of June 2, 1955, the effect of this order was to take the case from the Appellate Division of the District Court and return it to the Island Court. The District Court then had nothing before it. It became the responsibility of the Island Court to make such further disposition as it might determine. It took immediate action to consult with the parties, and belatedly, under date of October 6, 1958, entered an order dismissing the appeal for delay. There was no appeal pending and the effect of this order was to dismiss further proceedings in the Island Court except compliance by the administratrix with the decree of the Court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b79-3\">We have now examined the files and transcript in the case and determine that there is nothing in the appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>brief which requires us, as a matter of law, to reverse. Many points are raised for the first time on appeal. The administratrix has been permitted to delay this case far too long. We affirm.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The lease was executed June 5, 1959. but was made effective May 15, 1959. These dates are of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>some importance because they indicate that the appellant had been in possession of the leased premises before the lease was executed. The appellant contends that paragraph III is clear and unambiguous and that, therefore, the Court was not justified in resorting to parol testimony in aid of its construction. This paragraph provides:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b85-3\">\u201cThe rental for the real property, herein described, shall be Fifty dollars ($50.00) a month. However, the rental payment shall be deducted from the total cost already and/or to be expended for the improvement of the store building and in behalf of the betterment of the business. The receipts of material and labor costs shall be compiled together by the Lessee and to be made manifest to the Lessors. After all cost of labor and material shall have been paid off from the proposed monthly rental as stated above, rental payment shall be made monthly in advance and shall be of the amount of Fifty dollars ($50.00).\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b85-4\">We agree with the Island Court that this paragraph standing alone is not free from ambiguity and that the Court was justified in receiving testimony as to the intention of the parties. The Court entered Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, in which it held that the appellant was justified in deducting from, rental payments improvements in the amount of Six Hundred Seventy-seven and 09/100 Dollars ($677.09), but that additional improvements amounting to Four Hundred Seventy-four and 65/100 Dollars ($474.65) were not allowable in that the appellees did not give any consent nor were they informed that the second improvement was to be undertaken. We do not agree that if the second improvement was to be undertaken the appellees had to be informed in advance and give their consent. The only requirement in the lease is that the receipts of material and labor costs shall be compiled together by the Lessee and to be made manifest to the Lessors. The dictionary defines \u201cmanifest\u201d as \u201cevident to the senses, especially to the sight; hence, obvious to the understanding; not ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>scure.\u201d This requirement standing alone would seem to mean that the Lessee-Appellant was only required to produce evidence that the expenditures had been made.</p>\n    <p id=\"b86-5\">However, the history of this transaction indicates that the improvements which were authorized were those which were in contemplation of the parties at the time the lease was executed. The Court referred to a rental agreement dated May 15, 1959, marked for identification as Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 2. This is a simple statement signed by the appellees but not by the appellant and provides for a monthly rental on a monthly basis, with the privilege of taking back the store by giving the appellant thirty (30) days\u2019 notice. Paragraph III refers to the total cost already and/or to be expended for the improvement of the store building. From this it would appear that the appellant was engaged in making improvements at the time the lease was executed. The first improvements involved the construction of toilet and urinal facilities, including the digging of a cesspool, certainly an essential for the operation of a store building; but the second improvements consisting of relocating partitions, conversion of a partition from a single to a double wall, installation of a ceiling to a portion of the building, and relocation of electrical connections, etc., appear to be valuable but not essential. The appellant would have us assume that the lease made it entirely discretionary with him as to whether he would pay a rental or whether he would use the equivalent amount of rental to improve the premises, but we think the converse is true, that the lease refers to expenditures in contemplation of the parties, i.e., toilet facilities. This view is strengthened by paragraph V of the lease which reads as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b86-6\">\u201cIt is further mutually agreed by and between the parties to this contract that the Lessee may not assign nor sublet any remainder or part of this Leasehold Agreement then existing to any third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>party. It is further mutually agreed by and between the parties to this contract that the Lessors shall pay to the Lessee in lump sum all cost of labor and material expended for the improvement and efficiency of the business, should the Lessee, for legitimate reasons, become incapacitated to carry on the remaining part of this Leasehold Agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b87-3\">It will be noted that this paragraph obligates the Lessors to reimburse the Lessee for expenditures made by him should he be unable to carry on the remaining part of the lease term. It does not appear logical that the parties intended that the appellant should have the right to make any expenditures he desired for improvements unlimited as to type or amount andthat the Lessors would pay for such improvements if the Lessee became incapacitated. Such provision would be logical if it meant improvements contemplated by the parties when the lease was signed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b87-4\">In.summary, this is another instance in which the trial court was required to construe a written instrument with all of the ambiguities inherent in non-professional draftsmanship. The trial court assumed that if the parties had intended that rentals should take the form of improvements exclusively, they would have said so. We can do no better on appeal than the Court did in the course of trial, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The motion was heard on August 8, 1978, and decision was reserved.</p>\n    <p id=\"b600-10\">Defendant seeks to prevent the introduction of evidence concerning, or references to, the frame of a certain Bernardelli semi-automatic pistol, serial number 46362, as the weapon allegedly used by the defendant to perpetrate the crimes for which he is being tried herein.</p>\n    <p id=\"b600-11\">The Bernardelli frame in question was found in the vicinity of the Maina Reservoir. The serial number, which had been filed off, was raised. Using this restored serial number, the firearm registration card for the weapon was traced. The description on the registration card stated that the weapon was a Bernardelli pistol, model 90, .22 caliber. The Government purchased and test-fired the same model and caliber Bernardelli pistol, after which the chief criminalist for the Department of Public Safety then compared the test-fired shell casings with shell casings found at Two Lovers Point and at the Texiera residence. His analysis was as follows :</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b600-12\">The markings on the casings are consistent, which leads me to believe that a Bernardelli could have fired those casings that were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>recovered from the Texiera house and also from Two Lovers Point. Grand Jury Transcript, May 26, 1978, page 23.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b601-3\">The characteristics of the firing pin were so unique, they were so outstanding that there\u2019s no way, in my opinion, that I can find another gun that would give the same markings that I found with those comparisons, . . . What I\u2019m saying is the markings are so unique that no other weapon could have fired those that I matched. Grand Jury Transcript, May 26, 1978, pages 28, 29.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b601-4\">A comparison was also made between the slugs from the purchased Bernardelli and slugs recovered from the bodies of the two Japanese women during autopsy. The chief criminalist found that \u201cthe refiling characteristics, that is the width of the land and the width of the groove are consistent again with the Bernardelli.\u201d Grand Jury Transcript, May 26, 1978, page 25.</p>\n    <p id=\"b601-5\">The basis of defendant\u2019s motion is his contention that the introduction into evidence of the Bernardelli frame will have a \u201cprejudicial effect on the minds of the jurors that cannot be erased by the defense, irrespective of the Government\u2019s inability to state with a legal certainty that the .22 caliber shell casings found at Two Lovers Leap were ejected by the pistol alleged to be the murder weapon.\u201d <em>However, legal certainty is not the standard which must be met for the introduction of evidence in a criminal </em>case. <em>Rather, evidence must generally only be probative in order to be admissible. </em>The court in <em>People v. Lindsay, </em>227 C.A.2d 482, 38 Cal. Rptr. 755 (1964), enunciated this rule as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b601-6\">The general tests of the admissibility of evidence in a criminal case are . . . does it tend logically, naturally, and by reasonable inference, to establish any fact material for the people, or to overcome any material matter sought to be proved by the defense? 227 C.A.2d at 498.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b601-7\">Referring specifically to firearm identification, McCormick has written:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>It has long been recognized by the courts that the jury deciding questions of identification operates on the basis not of unattainable absolute certainty, but of probability. McCormick, McCormick on Evidence, Sec. 204 (2d ed., 1972).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b602-5\">Probative ballistic evidence is generally admissible. The degree of its probativeness is not determinative of its admissibility, but rather of the weight to be given to the evidence by the jury. The court in <em>State v. Thomas, </em>489 P.2d 1310 (1971), stated this rule as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b602-6\">There is no requirement that weapons or bullets offered in evidence be positively identified as those used in the perpetration of a crime. The admission of such evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court and any objection to the lack of positive identification goes to the weight of the evidence rather than to the admissibility of the article. 489 P.2d at 1313.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b602-7\">In <em>State v. Hatton, </em>522 P.2d 64 (1974), an expert testified that it was impossible to determine whether the bullet fragments removed from the victim\u2019s head had been fired from the alleged murder weapon because the fragments were too distorted to reveal characteristics. Notwithstanding this, the expert was permitted to testify that the pistol was capable of firing bullets of the type used in the murder, the court finding that any objection to the lack of positive identification went to the weight of the evidence rather than to its admissibility.</p>\n    <p id=\"b602-8\">In <em>State v. Krummacher, </em>523 P.2d 1009 (1974), an unusual firearm and bullet had been used in the crime and the defendant had had access to that particular type of weapon. The weapon itself was never recovered. The court permitted the introduction of neutron activation analyses, conducted to determine if the fatal bullets could have been from the same manufacturer\u2019s batch as the bullets found in the defendant\u2019s possession. Defendant contested the sufficiency of the evidence used in determining if the bullets were from the same batch. On appeal, the court stated:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b603-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>[I]t is a matter that goes to the evidence\u2019s convincing power rather than to its admissibility. . . . All of the weaknesses and strengths of the State\u2019s analyses were fully disclosed by the expert testimony from both sides and the jury had an adequate opportunity to give the testimony the weight it merited. While we believe the convincing power of the evidence was not very great, it nevertheless had some probative value and was admissible. 523 P.2d at 1017.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b603-3\">In <em>State v. Edgin, </em>520 P.2d 288 (1974), the court upheld the admissibility of a ballistic expert\u2019s testimony, despite his having testified that he could not positively say that the bullets came from the appellant\u2019s gun, but only that the appellant\u2019s gun could not be eliminated as the murder weapon. The <em>Edgin </em>court reiterated that the fact that the expert testimony did not establish a probability went merely to the weight of the testimony, rather than to its admissibility. See <em>Edgin, </em>supra, at 294.</p>\n    <p id=\"b603-4\">Defendant\u2019s position is that the comparison tests which were conducted by the chief criminalist do not support the inference that the Bernardelli pistol frame found in the vicinity of the Maina Reservoir is part of the murder weapon. As authority, defendant cites from <em>Edwards v. State, </em>83 A.2d 578, 26 A.L.R.2d 874, 881 (1951), which states in pertinent part:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b603-5\">The testimony now in question is not discredited by the circumstances that the comparison of the two cartridge cases which had been exposed to the elements, with the .test cartridge supported the inference that could not be drawn from comparisons of the two alone.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b603-6\">Defendant\u2019s argument is not persuasive. In <em>Edwards, </em>the two cartridge cases which had been exposed to the elements were found respectively in appellant\u2019s background and near the scene. Expert testimony explained why an inference could not be drawn from a comparison of the two alone:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Everytime a weapon fires a cartridge case, the firing pin may impress to different depths. Therefore, the cartridge case will pick up additional marks on a cartridge case in which the firing pin makes a deep impression as contrasted with one in which a shallow impression is made. So that an insufficient number of microscopic marks might be present on one cartridge case from a certain weapon for comparison with another cartridge case fired from the same weapon. I examined the specimen when it was originally submitted as Q-12 and found there were very few microscopic marks in the firing pin impression. At that time I concluded they were too few for comparison with another cartridge case. However, when I received the weapon and fired the test cartridge case from it, I found on this cartridge case microscopic marks which were the same as microscopic marks I found on the cartridge case submitted to me as having been recovered in Edwards\u2019 yard, indicating that that cartridge case . . . was fired from this particular weapon. 26 A.L.R.2d at 882.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b604-5\">Thus, the Court would not have permitted an inference from a comparison of the two cartridges because there were too few microscopic marks in the firing pin impression to compare the two. <em>Edwards </em>did not establish that only shell casings test-fired by the alleged murder weapon could be used for comparison.</p>\n    <p id=\"b604-6\">Based on <em>Hatton, Krummacher, Edgin </em>and <em>Edwards, </em>this Court finds that evidence concerning the Bernardelli frame, serial number 46362, is sufficiently probative of the issue of the identities of the alleged murder weapon to allow its admission into evidence.</p>\n    <p id=\"b604-7\">Defendant\u2019s motion is denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b604-8\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

THEODORE K. WASHINGTON, Defendant</parties>\n  <docketnumber id=\"AYa\">Criminal Case No. 148F-78</docketnumber>\n  <court id=\"Al2\">Superior Court of Guam</court>\n  <decisiondate id=\"b616-5\">October 19, 1978</decisiondate>\n  <opinion type=\"majority\">\n    <author id=\"b616-13\">WEEKS, <em>Judge</em></author>\n    <p id=\"b616-14\">DECISION</p>\n    <p id=\"b616-15\">This case comes before the Court on defendant Theodore Washington\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment filed September 28, 1978, and argued October 12, 1978. The motion is based on the ground that the prosecution violated the mandate of Criminal Procedure Code \u00a7 50.46 by failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>present to the grand jury a note, allegedly written by the victim, which recites a motive for individuals other than the defendant to have committed the crime which is the basis of this action.</p>\n    <p id=\"b617-3\">Criminal Procedure Code \u00a7 50.46 reads:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b617-4\">The grand jury shall receive only evidence presented to it by the prosecuting attorney but the prosecuting attorney shall submit any evidence in his possession which would tend to negate guilt and the grand jury shall weigh all evidence submitted.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b617-5\">The People defended their failure to introduce the note on the ground that the note was inadmissible hearsay and as such could not be presented to the grand jury due to the requirements of Criminal Procedure Code \u00a7 50.42. That Section reads in pertinent part:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b617-6\">The grand jury shall receive only evidence which would be admissible over objection at the trial of a criminal action. . . .</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b617-7\">Disposition of this motion turns upon the admissibility of the note written by the victim. Defendant maintains it is admissible pursuant to the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n    <p id=\"b617-8\">In a case in which the state of mind of a person is relevant to a material issue in the case, his declarations at that time are admissible as proof on that issue. When evidence of such declarations is introduced solely for the purpose of showing what the state of mind of that person was at the time the declarations were made, the declarations are regarded as acts from which the state of mind may be inferred and the truth of the declaration is immaterial. For this reason some courts treat such declarations as non-hearsay rather than a hearsay exception. See generally McCormick on Evidence (2d ed. 1972) Section 294; Jones on Evidence (6th ed. 1972) Section 8:6.</p>\n    <p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>In the instant case it is difficult to see how the state of mind of the victim is at issue. Even if we assume that the victim\u2019s state of mind is at issue, the declaration goes to the motive of persons other than the defendant to commit the crime. The great weight of authority holds that evidence tending merely to show that persons other than the defendant had a motive for the commission of the crime is inadmissible unless coupled with other evidence having an inherent tendency to connect such other person with the actual commission of the crime. <em>People v. Mendez, </em>193 Cal. 39, 223 P. 65 (1924); <em>People v. Perkins, </em>8 Cal.2d 502 (1937); <em>State v. Perelli, </em>125 Conn. 321, 5 A.2d 705; <em>State v. Kwan, 174 </em>Wash. 528, 25 P.2d 104 (1933).</p>\n    <p id=\"b618-5\">It seems to us that there is a sound basis for this rule and that it rests fundamentally upon the same consideration which led to the early adoption of the elementary rules that evidence to be admissible must be both relevant and material. It rests upon the necessity that trials of cases must be both orderly and expeditious, that they must come to an end, and that it should be a logical end. To this end it is necessary that the scope of inquiry into collateral and unimportant issues must be strictly limited. It is quite apparent that if evidence of motive alone upon the part of other persons were admissible, that in a case involving the killing of a man who had led an active and aggressive life it might easily be possible for the defendant to produce evidence tending to show that hundreds of other persons had some motive or <em>animus </em>against the deceased; that a great many trial days might be consumed in the pursuit of inquiries which could not be expected to lead to any satisfactory conclusion. 193 Cal. 39, 52.</p>\n    <p id=\"b618-6\">In the case of <em>People v. Peete, </em>28 Cal.2d 306, 169 P.2d 924 (1946), defendant attempted to introduce the hearsay declaration of the murder victim which recited that a certain third person had threatened to kill her. The Court was upheld in denying the admission on the ground that the victim\u2019s state of mind concerning the third person was not at issue until defendant asserted her defense that the third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>person was the actual perpetrator. In that case, the Court assumed that the declaration would have been admissible after evidence regarding the defense\u2019s theory was introduced. However, the defense never attempted to reintroduce the declaration into evidence after evidence of the third party\u2019s involvement was before the Court. It should be noted that in <em>Peete </em>there was substantial evidence circumstantially linking the third person with the crime.</p>\n    <p id=\"b619-3\">In the instant case the state of mind of the victim regarding other persons is not at issue. Furthermore, there is no additional evidence tending to link the third persons with the perpetration of the crime. It is clear that the victim\u2019s note was not admissible before the grand jury.</p>\n    <p id=\"b619-4\">It would be totally unreasonable to require the prosecution to put before the grand jury every bit of evidence which by some speculative theory <em>might </em>be admissible at some later time.</p>\n    <p id=\"b619-5\">It should be noted that the prosecution\u2019s argument that the note was inadmissible because it was not authenticated is unpersuasive. If such were true, the prosecution could withhold exculpatory evidence solely because they were unwilling to lay the necessary foundation. Such a rule would be absurd.</p>\n    <p id=\"b619-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment is hereby denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b619-7\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Quinata, was driving to work in his personal automobile. The road upon which Quinata was driving was under construction and although not required to, he chose to drive on the left-hand side of the road because it was smoother than the right-hand side. There was no traffic except one vehicle (driven by one Sanchez) in front of Quinata which proceeded up the road in the right lane. Quinata traveled in the left lane at a speed of 25-30 miles per hour for three minutes prior to the collision which resulted in his injuries. The Sanchez vehicle passed the vehicle driven by co-defendant, Virgilio M. Cordova, which was to the side of the road on the left facing the Sanchez vehicle. As Cordova continued down the road in the opposite direction of the Sanchez and Quinata vehicles, he saw the lights of the Quinata vehicle approaching in his lane of traffic and stopped his vehicle just before the collision. Cordova was operating a piece of construction equipment known as a payloader. It had two front lights which were about six feet above the ground. Quinata did not see the payloader until he struck it head on. The payloader was owned by Jones <em>&amp; </em>Guerrero Company and Cordova was an employee of the company.</p>\n    <p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The jury found that Quinata was twenty-five percent negligent, Cordova twenty-five percent negligent and Jones &amp; Guerrero fifty percent negligent. Substantial damages were awarded plaintiff and the defendants appealed on several grounds.</p>\n    <p id=\"b450-5\">There is no doubt that the plaintiff, Quinata, was negligent and in. fact his own counsel concedes that issue since he was driving on the wrong side of the road at the time of the collision. The appellant asserts that the trial court erred in allowing an expert, Charles Woodall, to testify for the plaintiff and that the admission of his opinion regarding certain safety devices and equipment was prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b450-6\">A review of the transcript of the testimony convinces us that the only testimony which the jury could possibly have used to find Jones &amp; Guerrero Company, Inc., negligent was that of Woodall.</p>\n    <p id=\"b450-7\">Woodall, who is a safety manager for the U.S. Navy on Guam, testified that he was responsible for supervising the movement of heavy equipment on jobs under the control of the various Navy departments. (Tr. 180.) He further testified that he performs his job pursuant to Navy Regulations and the Occupational Health and Safety Act. (Tr. 182.) He had no control or jurisdiction over Jones &amp; Guerrero Company, Inc., nor any other private contractor unless the private contractor was working for the Navy on a Navy construction job. (Tr. 182-183.) Nevertheless, the witness was permitted to testify that construction equipment is not to be moved after dark unless there are \u201cbuffer vehicles\u201d with amber flashing lights in the front and back of the equipment. (Tr. 189.) It was the opinion of Woodall that in the case of the payloader which Cordova was driv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>ing, the ordinary standard of care required of people moving heavy equipment was not met.</p>\n    <p id=\"b451-3\">Sergeant Sab\u00edan, Assistant Commissioner of the Traffic Division, Department of Public Safety, Government of Guam, testified that there were no statutes, rules or regulations requiring any other lights than those on the pay-loader. (Tr. 314.) This fact was conceded to by plaintiff\u2019s counsel (Tr. 311).</p>\n    <p id=\"b451-4\">It is abundantly clear that whatever opinion Woodall gave was based upon Navy Regulations and the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651 et seq., neither of which is applicable to the case at bar. The conclusion becomes inescapable that the expert testimony and the opinion expressed was erroneously admitted and highly prejudicial to appellant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b451-5\">The only other possible theory of negligence which the jury could have accepted to impose liability on the defendants was the assertion by the plaintiff that Cordova should have driven further to his right and completely off the road when he saw Quinata approaching head on.</p>\n    <p id=\"b451-6\">The payloader was traveling about 10-15 miles per hour (Tr. 117-118). The Sanchez vehicle safely passed the pay-loader at which time Quinata\u2019s vehicle was about one hundred fifty feet behind except it was in the left lane. Quinata saw the lights on the payloader (Tr. 218) but it \u201c. . . seems to me like it was just lights from buildings on the left-hand side of the shoulder.\u201d Quinata denies seeing the payloader before the collision, never used his brakes and the crash was sudden. (Tr. 219.)</p>\n    <p id=\"b451-7\">There was evidence that there was space to the right of the payloader to pull further off the road. (Tr. 72.) However, the only person who could shed light on the possibility of avoiding the accident, Cordova, demonstrates the failure of proof as far as the plaintiff is concerned:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>\u201cQ. And do you recall seeing Mr. Quinata\u2019s vehicle before the collision ?</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b452-5\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b452-6\">\u201cQ. Would you explain to the Court in your own words exactly what happened ? Describe the few minutes before the incident took place in your own words.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b452-7\">\u201cA. When I saw that the car \u2014 that the car is going this way, I just stopped, step on my brakes, then that\u2019s it. The accident was there already. (Tr. 119.)</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b452-8\">\u201cQ. I show you Exhibit 4 which shows where the police cars were; and in Exhibit 4, if you had thought of it, you could have moved to that side of the road, could you ?</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b452-9\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b452-10\">\u201cQ. You couldn\u2019t have. Why couldn\u2019t you have?</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b452-11\">\u201cA. I would do it if \u2014 It\u2019s already there. The car was already there.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b452-12\">\u201cQ. Well, you had time to stop, did you?</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b452-13\">\u201cA. Yeah, that\u2019s \u2014 That\u2019s why what I had to do, just stopped.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b452-14\">\u201cQ. Well, you had time to stop but you didn\u2019t have time to turn off the road ?</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b452-15\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know. But the condition to that already \u2014 \u201d (Tr. 122).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b452-16\">After considering all the evidence which the jury had before it, including how the accident occurred, the speed of Quinata\u2019s vehicle and that of the payloader prior to its being stopped, it is concluded that there is no basis upon which the jury could have found Cordova negligent.</p>\n    <p id=\"b452-17\">As appropriately pointed out by the appellant and appellee, it is not for the reviewing court to reweigh the evidence. In this case, however, there is simply no evidence that will support a finding of negligence on the part of the appellants. Therefore, no new trial will be granted.</p>\n    <p id=\"b452-18\">In view of the above, the other matters raised on appeal by appellants do not require a determination by this court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b452-19\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The Court is of the opinion that for the following reasons this motion to dismiss must be denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b320-5\">Defendant asserts with respect to the first ground that this Court is without subject matter jurisdiction to entertain this matter because P.L. 12-85 Section 82 limits this court\u2019s jurisdiction to \u201cthose cases arising under the laws of Guam\u201d; and that since the matter here complained of arose in the Marshall Islands, and to an indeterminate extent will be controlled by the laws of that place, that this matter therefore falls without the subject matter jurisdictional limits of this Court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b320-6\"> The Court concurs with the assertion that the quoted phrase is definitive of the limits of the Superior Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. However, the Court interprets this phrase to indicate that the Superior Court of Guam has subject matter jurisdiction over all causes of action which the Guam Legislature has created or which may have existed at common law. In short these statutory and common law causes of actions define the kind or classes of actions which this Court is competent to entertain. See <em>Turnbaugh v. Dunlop, </em>94 N.E.2d 438 at 440 (1950). This Court does not interpret this phrase as limiting this Court\u2019s jurisdiction to those causes of action which not only fall within the above classes of actions but which physically arose within the territory of Guam, or which to some extent may be affected via the conflict of laws principles by the laws of a jurisdiction other than Guam. See <em>Turnbaugh v. Dunlop, </em>supra.</p>\n    <p id=\"b320-7\">In this instance plaintiff\u2019s complaint clearly indicates that the cause of action from which relief is sought essentially sounds in the tort of fraud. This cause of action existed at common law and therefore can be <em>generically </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>characterized as a common law cause of action, although numerous statutes have been enacted pertaining thereto. Since the complaint indicates that the cause of action is not only a traditionally recognized common law cause of action, but as well, one codified per operation of Civil Code Section 1571, etc., this Court considers it to be one within that class of actions over which this Court has competent subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n    <p id=\"b321-3\"> Defendant has further moved to dismiss on the grounds that plaintiff failed to join an indispensible party in contravention of Rule 19(b). From the face of the complaint it would appear that the individual who is alleged by defendant to be an indispensible party (i.e. Anibar Timothy) would be characterized as either a joint tortfeasor or the servant in a master-servant relationship. With respect to the first characterization it is hornbook law that one tortfeasor cannot ground a request for dismissal upon the claim that a fellow joint tortfeasor is an indispensible party. See <em>O\u2019Shatz v. Bailey, </em>220 F.Supp. 444 (D. Md. 1963). With respect to the latter characterization it is an equally fundamental principle that an action initiated against a principal is not res adjudicata with respect to same\u2019s agent, notwithstanding the fact that the principal\u2019s liability may be derivative. See <em>Makariw v. Rimard, </em>336 F.2d 333 (3rd cir. 1964). Therefore since the present action cannot affect the legal rights and/or obligations of Mr. Timothy there seems to be no reason for characterizing him as an indispensible party in this action.</p>\n    <p id=\"b321-4\">For the above reasons this motion to dismiss is denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b321-5\">Submit order.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Pangelinan, hereinafter called the defendant, was convicted of the offense of attempted extortion, as defined in Sec. 524 of the Penal Code of Guam. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>section makes it a criminal offense to attempt extortion, as defined in Sec. 519. Section 519, in part, provides</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b423-3\">Fear, such as will constitute extortion, may be induced by a threat, either:</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b423-4\">\u00ab5\u00bb \u00bb!\u00bb H*</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b423-5\">(3) To expose or impute to him or them any deformity or disgrace; or</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b423-6\">(4) To expose any secret affecting him or them.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b423-7\">The sole assignment of error is that the evidence introduced by the prosecution did not warrant conviction. We have repeatedly held that we will not disturb the findings of the lower court if there is credible evidence to support the judgment. In this case we find that there is more than adequate evidence to support the judgment and therefore we affirm.</p>\n    <p id=\"b423-8\">In March, 1965, the prosecuting witness, hereinafter called the victim, was a married woman, living at Andersen Air Force Base. Her husband\u2019s first name is James. In March she received a number of telephone calls from an unidentified male, informing her that the caller wished to borrow money from her and that he had in his possession five pictures and five negatives showing her in the nude. For these he wished to borrow $50 for each picture and additional money for each negative (Tr. 3). The victim was wise enough to report these calls to a Special Investigator at Andersen who, in turn, informed the Guam Police. On March 25th she received two calls and in the last call, at 7:00 or 7:30 in the evening, the voice told her to meet him approximately at Three Kings Apartments and to watch for a flashing light, stop her car, and to turn off the lights on her car (Tr. 3). The Special Investigator was notified and told her to come right over to his house, where they waited for a Guam Police Detective. The back seat of the Volkswagen, driven by the victim, was removed and the detective concealed himself under a blanket. The victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>proceeded as directed and after a few seconds saw a flashing light. She then proceeded upon the road, apparently a private road, stopped and turned off her lights. She then saw a man come up behind and look at her. She had locked the doors and had all of the windows up except the window on the driver\u2019s side. The man flashed his light on the back seat, saw the detective, and ran.</p>\n    <p id=\"b424-5\">The detective ran after him and fired two shots in the air. At no time did the victim identify the defendant as either the person who had telephoned to her or the person who had approached the automobile. The detective testified that he saw the blinking flashlight and directed the victim to drive in on the private road. He felt someone shaking the door of the car. When that person ran, the detective followed him for about 50 feet and the person went into the bushes. The detective called him to come out but he did not do so and the detective went in and found the defendant lying on his stomach with the flashlight on his right side. The detective told the defendant to come out, which he did with raised hands. The defendant asked him if he were James (the first name of the victim\u2019s husband). The detective identified himself as a police officer and the defendant said that since he was on private property and did not have a search warrant he was going to leave. For some reason the detective permitted him to do so. The detective described in detail how the defendant was dressed and the way the defendant wore his wrist watch, that the defendant had grease on his face. The detective took possession of the flashlight.</p>\n    <p id=\"b424-6\">The next day the defendant, a mechanic, was picked up and taken to the police station. The detective testified unconditionally that the person who was picked up had the appearance and characteristics of the man he had seen the night before. No evidence was introduced as to what transpired at the police station but the detective testified that his. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>superior officer instructed him to have the defendant released, which he did. The defendant was released (Tr. 11) and complained that he was unable to obtain a ride to the point where he was picked up. The detective informed him that there would be a ride for him in a few minutes. The defendant then stated that he had made a mistake the previous night, that he was actually out hunting deer and that his flashlight was blinking and he made a deer cry, but when he saw a car coming from the highway he ran away and got scared and dropped his flashlight. This statement, which was subsequently admitted by the defendant, clearly placed the defendant at the scene.</p>\n    <p id=\"b425-3\">The defendant attempted to establish the defense of alibi with the usual alibi witnesses, wife, father, and relative. The defendant contended that he was in the general vicinity for the purpose of pasturing his father\u2019s cows and that he became frightened when he heard a shot. Under cross-examination the defendant admitted the statement to the detective that he was hunting deer at night, but that he didn\u2019t have to tell the truth to the detective as he was not under oath. The testimony of the defendant\u2019s wife was equally unconvincing, but she admitted that she had seen the victim enter an apartment in front of the defendant\u2019s apartment; that she had taken the license number of the victim\u2019s car and had contacted the license section of the government of Guam to determine the ownership. Her only reason for this unusual interest was that her husband had been missing tools.</p>\n    <p id=\"b425-4\">The above outline is not intended to be complete but simply to indicate the adequacy of the evidence which was before the trial court. The victim had received instructions as to where to go, she had been informed that she would be guided by a blinking flashlight. The defendant was at the location mentioned, he did blink a flashlight. He did flee and he did ask the detective if he was the victim\u2019s husband. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>The defendant\u2019s testimony indicated an unusual interest in identifying the victim and we have no doubt as to the correctness of the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b426-3\">Both counsel advised that oral argument would be waived.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Gerber\u2019s Motion to Dismiss filed July 28, 1978, and argued August 3, 1978.</p>\n    <p id=\"b595-6\">Defendant maintains that: (1) the finding of no probable cause to bind him for trial on drug charges which are the basis of this forfeiture action serves as collateral estoppel as to the issue of his knowledge of drugs on the vessel, and (2) <em>Guam\u2019s forfeiture statute, Criminal and Correctional Code </em>\u00a7 <em>67.80 et seq., </em>is defective in that it denies him the due process right to notice and hearing either before or after seizure.</p>\n    <p id=\"b595-7\">Defendant\u2019s first argument is unpersuasive. The finding of no probable cause at the preliminary examination is not a final judgment sufficient to serve as collateral estoppel in a civil proceeding. Therefore, the Court must reach defendant\u2019s due process argument.</p>\n    <p id=\"b595-8\">It is clear that under forfeiture statutes post-seizure notice and hearing are sufficient. In the case of <em>Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., </em>416 U.S. 663, 94 S.Ct. 2080 (1974), the Supreme Court recognized that in certain situations to serve an important government interest due process is not denied by postponement of notice and hearing. That case involved the seizure of a leased yacht used to transport marijuana. The court took note of the public interest in preventing the illicit use of property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>as well as the fact that the yacht could easily be removed from the jurisdiction if pre-seizure notice was given.</p>\n    <p id=\"b596-5\">In these circumstances, we hold that this case presents an \u201cextraordinary\u201d situation in which postponement of notice and hearing until after seizure did not deny due process. 94 S.Ct. 2080, 2080.</p>\n    <p id=\"b596-6\">Guam\u2019s forfeiture statute closely parallels the Federal statute (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881) except in one notable area. Section (d) of the Federal law made applicable other provisions of law relating to judicial forfeiture. This would include, among others, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604 which requires the U.S. Attorney to commence forfeiture proceedings when necessary. There is no provision in the Guam law which requires, or authorizes, the institution of forfeiture proceedings. Indeed, it appears that the sole determination of whether forfeiture is required is in the hands of the Governor. See Criminal and Correctional Code \u00a7 67.84.</p>\n    <p id=\"b596-7\">The issue before this Court is whether \u00a7 67.84 which allows an aggrieved person to seek review in Superior Court after forfeiture satisfies due process requirements. The Supreme Court stated in the <em>Calero-Toledo </em>decision:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b596-8\">No challenge is made to the District Court\u2019s determination that the form of post-seizure notice satisfied due process requirements . . . <em>Notice, of course, was required to be \u201creasonably calculated to apprise [the </em>company] <em>of the pendency of the forfeiture proceedings.\u201d </em>(Citation omitted.) (Emphasis added.) 94 S.Ct. 2090.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b596-9\">Guam\u2019s statute contains no provision for the notification to the aggrieved party of the pendency of forfeiture proceedings. In the instant case the Government did file forfeiture proceedings and did attempt to notify appropriate parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, these good faith efforts will not suffice when defendant\u2019s challenge is to the statute itself.</p>\n    <p id=\"b596-10\">In <em>State v. Matheason, </em>84 Wash.2d 388, 524 P.2d 388 (1974), an action was filed seeking the return of a vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>seized pursuant to Washington\u2019s forfeiture statute which is very similar to Guam\u2019s. The action was grounded on the argument that the statute was unconstitutional in that it failed to provide post-seizure notice and hearing. The Supreme Court of Washington agreed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b597-3\">There is no provision in RCW 69.50.505 (b) (4) for notice and hearing even after seizure. While <em>Calero </em>holds that in an extraordinary-situation such as this notice and hearing may be postponed until after seizure, it does not allow for abolishment of notice and a hearing. 524 P.2d 590.</p>\n    <p id=\"b597-4\">It is worthy of note that in <em>Matheason </em>the Government had countered with a motion to forfeit the vehicle. This attempt to provide due process was apparently ineffective when the statute did not so provide.</p>\n    <p id=\"b597-5\">The <em>Calero-Toledo </em>decision mandates that forfeiture statutes provide post-seizure notice and hearing prior to forfeiture. Guam\u2019s statute lacks such provisions and therefore denies due process which is required under the Organic Act.</p>\n    <p id=\"b597-6\">Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss is granted.</p>\n    <p id=\"b597-7\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n      <p id=\"b596-11\"> Although in <em>Cal&amp;ro-Toledo </em>the lessee rather than the actual owner was notified, the case strongly suggests that notice to the owner is required. See footnote 8, 94 S.Ct. 2080, 2084.</p>\n    </footnote>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Extensive oral argument was held on two occasions and the parties submitted numerous and detailed briefs. In addition, upon oral argument respondent requested and was granted permission to supplement its original submissions by depositions, answers to interrogatories, and further affidavits in accordance with Superior Court of Guam Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e). Respondent has not set forth any specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial of the following material facts.</p>\n    <p id=\"b340-7\">Petitioner is engaged on Guam in the business of selling at retail various types of merchandise. Petitioner has the exclusive right to sell liquor, tobacco products, and other merchandise at the International Air Terminal (the \u201cAir Terminal\u201d) and the exclusive right to sell all such products anywhere on Guam for delivery at the Air Terminal.</p>\n    <p id=\"b340-8\">No liquor or tobacco is delivered to a purchaser except in the sterile area of the Air Terminal. Either the liquor and tobacco is loaded in the belly of the aircraft for claim by the purchaser at his ultimate destination, or it is handed to him in the boarding process shortly before he departs Guam. The liquor and tobacco is delivered for the sole purpose of exporting it from Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b340-9\">Petitioner pays gross receipts taxes on all sales made to customers at petitioner\u2019s shops located other than at the Air Terminal, except sales of liquor and tobacco, delivery of which is made to the Air Terminal.</p>\n    <p id=\"b340-10\">Petitioner was assessed additional gross receipts taxes in the amount of $253,996.70 for 1973. Of this amount, gross receipts taxes attributable to liquor and tobacco sales are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>$153,022.91. Petitioner was also .assessed additional gross receipts taxes in the amount of $270,876.18 for 1974. Included within this amount is $211,352.05 for sales of liquor and tobacco.</p>\n    <p id=\"b341-3\">Guam\u2019s gross receipts tax is a privilege tax which may not legally be applied to interstate or foreign commerce. <em>Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle, </em>421 U.S. 100 (1975); <em>Manila Trading &amp; Supply Co. (Guam) v. Maddox, </em>335 F.2d 150 (9th Cir. 1964). Petitioner\u2019s sales and delivery of liquor and tobacco are in the flow of interstate and foreign commerce and are protected by the Constitution. See <em>Manila Trading &amp; Supply Co. (Guam), </em>supra; <em>Hostetter v. Idelwild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp., </em>377 U.S. 324 (1964); <em>Epstein v. Lordi, </em>261 F.Supp. 921 (D.N.J. 1966); <em>Ammex Warehouse Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Alcoholic Bev. Con., </em>224 F.Supp. 546 (S.D. Cal. 1963). Accordingly, so much of the assessment in each of the years 1973 and 1974 that is attributable to sales of liquor and tobacco is unconstitutional and must be abated.</p>\n    <p id=\"b341-4\">Included within the aggregate amount of the assessment for 1973 is the sum of $29,369.08 which was disallowed by respondent as a tax credit on tobacco tax admittedly paid by petitioner\u2019s distributors. Petitioner is entitled to the drawback. Respondent has failed to set forth any specific facts to support its allegation that petitioner has not satisfied the requirements of Section 19592 of the Government Code of Guam. On the contrary, it is clear that both the purpose and specific requirements of the section have been complied with. The petitioner is entitled to a tobacco tax drawback in the amount of $29,369.08, and the assessment for 1973 should be further abated accordingly.</p>\n    <p id=\"b341-5\">While as to all sales of liquor and tobacco and the tobacco tax drawback there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and petitioner is entitled to a judgment as a matter of lav/, issues of fact do exist with regard to sales other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>liquor and tobacco made by petitioner and these should not be decided on a motion for summary judgment.

Roger Crouthamel appeared on behalf of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>plaintiff and Harry Boertzel appeared for defendant. The motion was heard before the Honorable Janet H. Weeks, and decision was reserved.</p>\n    <p id=\"b651-3\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion for default judgment is premised on the failure of G.M.H.A. to answer the complaint within the twenty (20) days provided by Rule 12(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. G.M.H.A. contends that it is a government agency within the meaning of Rule 12(a) and, therefore, has sixty (60) days within which to answer. The Court notes that the parties have proceeded with the action on the understanding that there has been no waiver.</p>\n    <p id=\"b651-4\">Rule 12(a) was adopted from Rule 12(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure except that \u201cthe Government\u201d appears in lieu of \u201cthe United States\u201d. Rule 12(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil procedure reads:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b651-5\">The Government or an officer or agency thereof shall serve an answer to the complaint, . . . within sixty (60) days after service upon the Government of the pleading in which the claim is asserted.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b651-6\">Federal interpretation of the term agency is therefore persuasive. The case of <em>Ramsey v. United Mine Workers, </em>27 F.R.D. 423 (1961), is often cited as an authority. It states that:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b651-7\">It is logical to decide that \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of Kule 12 (a) is an agency, corporate or otherwise, whose authority under congressional enactment is solely to perform governmental service as distinguished from an agency that is limited in performing governmental functions, such as a national bank.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b651-8\">Statutorily, agency has been defined by 28 U.S.C.A. 451, as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b651-9\">The term \u201cagency\u201d includes any department, independent establishment, commission, administration, authority, board or bureau of the United States or any corporation in which the United States has a proprietary interest, unless the context shows that such term was intended to be used in a more limited sense.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>The Court finds that G.M.H.A. qualifies as an agency within the meaning of Rule 12(a). G.M.H.A. was established by Public Law 14-29, Government Code \u00a7 49002. In so creating G.M.H.A. the Legislature provided that:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b652-5\">There is within, and a public corporation and autonomous instrumentality of the government of Guam called the Guam Memorial Hospital Authority:</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b652-6\">Section 49003(a) mandates G.M.H.A. to:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b652-7\">Maintain and operate a facility providing acute, chronic and all other health care services for the people of the Territory.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b652-8\">All powers vested in the hospital are exercised by a Board nominated and appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Legislature. Furthermore, as an instrumentality of the Territory, the property and revenue of the hospital are exempt from taxation by the Territory. G.M.H.A. has sufficient characteristics of a governmental agency for purposes of Rule 12(a).</p>\n    <p id=\"b652-9\">For the aforementioned reasons, plaintiff\u2019s Motion is DENIED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b652-10\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The single issue on appeal is whether or not the trial court substantially complied with the provisions of the jury selection and service law.</p>\n    <p id=\"b469-4\">On the morning of trial the jury panel was to be assigned to three different judges. The presiding judge in a murder trial unrelated to defendant\u2019s case instructed the jury clerk not to send him any jurors who had served in <em>People v. Sablan </em>(No. 184F-75), a case involving the same homicide over which he was presiding (but with regard to another defendant). Since the jurors previously called in the <em>Sab\u00edan </em>case were excluded from the murder trial a greater percentage perhaps were called for defendant\u2019s trial and defendant contends that his legal right to a random selection of jurors was violated.</p>\n    <p id=\"b469-5\">Clearly, the burden rests on defendant to show that there was a substantial failure to comply with the provisions of the Guam Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 680 et seq. which properly deals with the selection of jury panels. Defendant has not alleged that the selection of the master list was improper and generally the focus of the law is on the list from which the jury is drawn and not on the composition of a particular jury. <em>Rabinowitz v. United States, </em>366 F.2d 34, 59 (6th Cir. 1966).</p>\n    <p id=\"b469-6\">In <em>Cain v. United States, </em>19 F.2d 472 (8th Cir. 1927), the court at page 475 described an argument similar to that of defendant here as being \u201ctoo frivolous for extensive notice.\u201d According to the court, a defendant is not entitled to have a jury trial selected from the entire panel of veniremen:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b469-7\">(5) The contention that defendant was entitled to have a trial jury selected from the entire panel embraced in the venire for the term is, of course, too frivolous for extensive notice. All he was entitled to was a jury of 12 unbiased and unprejudiced jurors out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>any part of the regular panel, if there were enough of such panel not engaged in other cases on trial to provide so many; if not, then a jury composed of talesmen, together with such remainder of the regular panel as a nucleus, as were not otherwise engaged and serving. The former he got, and he can ask no more.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b470-5\"><em>United States v. Davis, </em>456 F.2d 1192 (10th Cir. 1972), deals with a similar fact issue where jurors were argued to be \u201cleft-overs\u201d from another trial. It seems that those excused from jury duty at another trial were immediately directed to report to the courtroom where the defendant-appellant was being tried. On these facts an even stronger argument could be made that defendant\u2019s right to a random selection had been violated. However, on page 1196 of its decision, the Court of Appeals refused to find error:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b470-6\">Davis alleges improper jury selection procedures. He complains that the jury venire members were \u201cleft-overs\u201d from another trial. There was another case being tried to a jury at the same time as the Davis trial. Those excused from jury duty at the other trial were directed to report to the courtroom where Davis\u2019 trial was to be heard. Davis contends that this procedure is not in accord with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1864. He cites no authorities in support of his contention and he does not demonstrate any prejudice. Davis was provided a lawful panel from which the jury was selected. <em>Frazier v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 497, 69 S.Ct. 201, 93 L.Ed. 187 (1948).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b470-7\">Defendant has offered only one case dealing with the proper procedure that a clerk should use in drawing and assigning jurors. <em>Krause v. Chartier, </em>406 F.2d 898 (1st Cir. 1968). In that case jurors were chosen alphabetically as defendant suggests, quoting from the decision at page 1 of his Amended Reply Brief. However, defendant\u2019s lawyer has chosen to omit the last half of this paragraph, the portion holding that such a practice does not constitute reversible error:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b470-8\">Nonetheless, plaintiff has not been able to show, or suggest, any prejudice, and we are not persuaded of any. We see no imminent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>danger of ultimate unrepresentative selection such, as appeared in <em>New England Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, </em>1 Cir., 1968, 400 F.2d 58. In the absence of the likelihood of some general prejudice, we find inapplicable to rule of <em>Ballard v. United States, </em>1946 329 U.S. 187, 195, 67 S.Ct. 261, 265, 91 L.Ed. 181 (where class of citizens systematically excluded from jury panels, \u201creversible error does not depend on a showing of prejudice in an individual case\u201d). [At page 901.]</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b471-3\">Similarly, in <em>United States v. Valentine, </em>288 F.Supp. 957 (D. Puerto Rico 1968), the court held that where minor inconsistencies are shown, prejudice must generally result to gain a reversal. (At page 978.)</p>\n    <p id=\"b471-4\">Defendant has failed in his burden to show substantial non-compliance with the provisions of Guam\u2019s jury selection and service law. The jurors who were earlier called in the <em>Sab\u00edan </em>murder case were randomly chosen and their exclusion from the related murder case being tried concurrently with defendant\u2019s case could at best have only a minimum eifect on the randomness quotient. Even the one case directly on point cited by defendant requires a showing of prejudice where there is a minor inconsistency in the assigning of jurors. Defendant has made no such showing. The Trial Court substantially complied with the provisions of the jury selection law and protected defendant\u2019s right to 12 randomly chosen, impartial jurors! Affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Palas, from a judgment in a divorce action dividing the property of the parties.</p>\n    <p id=\"b444-14\">The background facts may be briefly stated. The parties commenced living together, without the benefit of marriage, in 1961. In 1966 plaintiff-appellant entered into an installment contract to purchase a piece of property in Finegayan, NCS, Guam, designated as Block 1, Lot 2, Dededo, Guam. Shortly thereafter, defendant-appellee and relatives of appellant built a home on the property and the parties moved in and resided there until their separation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>in 1972. The parties were married in 1967. Although the title to said property was actually obtained in the maiden name of appellant, appellee contributed approximately one-half of the purchase price. Subsequent to the marriage, the parties entered into an installment contract to purchase Lot 1, Block 3, Tract 172, Mogfog, Dededo, and the full purchase price has not yet been paid.</p>\n    <p id=\"b445-3\">The trial court, after hearing the evidence presented on behalf of the respective parties, granted appellant a divorce and awarded all of Lot 1, Block 3, Tract 172, Mogfog, Dededo, to the appellee and all of Finegayan, NCS, Guam, designated as Block 1, Lot 2, Dededo, Guam, to appellant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b445-4\">On appeal appellant contends the trial court\u2019s division of the property was error since the NCS property is her sole and separate property to which she is entitled as a matter of right, and that the Mogfog property should be divided equally between the parties in accordance with \u00a7 146(2) of the Civil Code of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b445-5\">Although the trial court did not specifically find the NCS property to be community property, it did hold, because of the manner in which it was acquired, it should be distributed in accordance with the same principles as community property.</p>\n    <p id=\"b445-6\">Appellant\u2019s contention that she is entitled to the NCS property as a matter of right must fail since all property of the parties to a divorce action, whether community or separate, is subject to the jurisdiction of the court. <em>Worthington v. Worthington </em>(1968), 440 P.2d 478.</p>\n    <p id=\"b445-7\">The ultimate question in such cases is whether the final division of the property is just and equitable and only a clear abuse of discretion will warrant this court\u2019s substituting its judgment for that of the trial court in a divorce proceeding property division. <em>Kennedy v. Kennedy </em>(1969), 452 P.2d 243. We find no abuse of discretion by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>trial court and therefore the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

If a defendant whose trial has not been postponed upon his application is not brought to trial within- 60 days after the filing of the information.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b280-5\">The indictment was returned August 15,1974. As of the date of the motion, the trial date had not been set.</p>\n    <p id=\"b280-6\">The motion must be denied on the following grounds:</p>\n    <p id=\"b280-7\">1. The provisions of Section 1382(2) were waived by implication through consent in open court to the continuing of the arraignment (transcript of September 4, 1974, page 3, lines 22 through 25, page 4, lines 1 and 2, and page 7, lines 13 through 15; transcript of September 11, 1974, page 17, lines 17 through 21) and through silence when the Court inquired, \u201cAll understand though that speedy trial complication (sic) does not start until after the arraignment?\u201d (transcript of September 4, 1974, page 3, lines 1 and 2). <em>People v. Tahtinen </em>(1958) 50 C.2d 131, 132, 323 P.2d 442.</p>\n    <p id=\"b280-8\">2. Good cause for the delay is shown because of the motion of the defendant of September 11, 1974, that the indictment be quashed. (Properly denominated a motion to dismiss.) This matter was heard on September 20, and the Court\u2019s order denying the motion was filed September 27. This motion had to be raised before trial (Rule 12(b) (2)), before the plea was entered (Rule 12(b) (3)), and the plea awaited the determination of the motion (Rule 12(b) (5)). See Witkin, California Criminal Procedure, Trial, Sec. 320 citing District Court of Appeal cases involving demurrer and prohibition.</p>\n    <p id=\"b280-9\">In addition to the above motion, the defendant moved on September 4 for a Bill of Particulars, and on October 3 for disclosure of grand jury proceedings, both being prior to the filing of this motion to dismiss.</p>\n    <p id=\"b280-10\"> 3. The territory has the procedural right to set forth time limits such as the one under consideration. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>Barker v. Wingo </em>(1972) 407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 2188, 33 L.Ed.2d 101. In determining whether a delay is for good cause, the constitutional standards can be properly examined. Four factors have been assessed: \u201cLength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant\u201d. <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>supra, 92 S.Ct. 2192. By this standard, the defendant has not been deprived of his right to a speedy trial guaranteed by the Organic Act, nor would he be entitled to a dismissal for unnecessary delay under Rule 48 (b).</p>\n    <p id=\"b281-3\">4. The United States Supreme Court has recognized conflicting policies in expediting criminal trials stating that a requirement \u201cof an unreasonable speed would have a deleterious effect both upon the rights of the accused and upon the ability of society to protect itself\u201d. <em>U.S. v. Ewell </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 116, 86 S.Ct. 773, 776, 15 L.Ed.2d, 627, 631. As the People\u2019s brief accurately points out, Clay was not really represented until the appointment of Mr. Cushnie on August 31. Orderly procedure required that counsel be appointed to protect the defendant\u2019s right to representation.</p>\n    <p id=\"b281-4\">In this case, the record reveals that it is necessary and convenient to have one trial. Among the factors existing are that both defendants were brought before the Magistrate at the same time, both were in custody, and both were indicted jointly.</p>\n    <p id=\"b281-5\">\u25a0 \"Not only was Clay\u2019s representation delayed but counsel for Reyes was permitted to withdraw on September 24, and his replacement was not appointed until October 18, 1974. Orderly procedure in this case called for trial setting after both had secured counsel and been arraigned. Where the continuation of the arraignment was caused by lack of representation of Reyes, the rights of his codefendant Clay \u201care generally not deemed to be prejudiced\u201d. <em>People v. Teale </em>(1965) 63 C.2d 178, 186, 45 C.R. 729, 404 P.2d 209, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>at p. 214; <em>Manson v.

Paul Lawlor appeared on behalf of the defendant and Lawrence Teker appeared for the plaintiff. The motion was heard before the Honorable Paul J. Abbate on January 15, 1979, and decision was reserved.</p>\n    <p id=\"b646-14\">The motion concerns the right of action of plaintiff against Guam Power Authority, an instrumentality of the government of Guam. The well-recognized principle that a sovereign cannot be sued in its own courts without the consent of Legislature was established in Guam by 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1421a. The issue presented by this motion is the extent to which the Legislature has waived G.P.A.\u2019s sovereign immunity.</p>\n    <p id=\"b646-15\">It is defendant\u2019s position that the relaxation of immunity is limited to the Government Claims Act, Chapter 6, Title VII of the Government Code of Guam. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with the Government Claims Act renders G.P.A. immune from suit. Plaintiff contends that G.P.A. is amenable to suit without regard to the Government Claims Act.</p>\n    <p id=\"b647-3\">Guam Power Authority was established under Government Code \u00a7 21502, which provides that:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b647-4\">There is within, and a public corporation and autonomous instrumentality of, the Government of Guam, a Guam Power Authority.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b647-5\">Government Code \u00a7 21503 delineates the powers granted to G.P.A. It states that:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b647-6\">The Authority shall have and exercise each and all of the following powers ... (5) ... sue or be sued in its own corporate name.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b647-7\">The \u201csue or be sued\u201d language seems to denote a general waiver of immunity to suit. However, Government Code \u00a7 6500.19, governing payment under the Government Claims Act, sets forth that:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b647-8\">Claims against . . . Guam Power Authority, . . . shall be paid only out of the funds of those agencies.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b647-9\">This infers that claims against G.P.A. are under the Government Claims Act.</p>\n    <p id=\"b647-10\">To resolve this ambiguity, it must initially be determined whether the \u201csue or be sued\u201d language is sufficient to constitute a general waiver of immunity from suit. In <em>Long v. Northeast Soil Conservation District of Los Angeles, </em>72 So.2d 543 (1954), the Court considered the extent to which a governmental agency with the power \u201cto sue and be sued in the name of the district\u201d had waived its immunity from suit. The Court held that:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b647-11\">... a Legislature, having the authority to establish an administrative or governmental agency, separate and distinct from the State as a sovereign entity, and having the right to waive immunity, can and does express that waiver when without restriction or qualification it empowers such agency to sue and be sued.... If the words are to be regarded as having any meaning whatsoever, they must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>be given the full meaning to which they are entitled by the dignity of definition and construction. 72 So.2d at 546, 548.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b648-5\">The U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Keifer v. Reconstruction Finance Corporation and Regional Agricultural Credit Corporation, </em>306 U.S. 381, 59 S.Ct. 516 at 518, analyzed the phrase \u201csue or to be sued\u201d as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b648-6\">. . . Congress has provided for not less than forty of such corporations discharging governmental functions, and without exception the authority to-sue-and-be-sued was included. Such a firm practice is partly an indication of the present climate of opinion which has brought governmental immunity from suit into disfavor, partly it reveals a definite attitude on the part of Congress which should be given hospitable scope.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b648-7\">The Court finds that the use of \u201csue or be sued\u201d language denotes a general waiver of immunity from suit.</p>\n    <p id=\"b648-8\">Thus a conflict exists when the \u201csue or be sued\u201d language is read in conjunction with \u00a7 6500.19 governing payment under the Government Claims Act. The Superior Court in <em>Manibusan v. Guam Memorial Hospital, </em>Civil Case No. 285-78, faced this ambiguity as it pertained to G.M.H.A. After an evaluation of the statutory scheme, the Court held that G.M.H.A. could be sued without regard to the Government Claims Act. This case is persuasive but not binding. The Court finds it necessary to examine the legislative and administrative construction of these statutes as applied to G.P.A.</p>\n    <p id=\"b648-9\">Unfortunately, the Guam Legislature has no record of the legislative history of these statutes. However, plaintiff has provided the Court with a transcript of the legislative debate on Bill No. 182. That Bill pertains to Guam Memorial Hospital and was enacted subsequent to the statutes in issue. In reviewing the transcript, the Court acknowledges that:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b648-10\">Although comments about an earlier act in a legislative committee report on a subsequent bill are not part of the legislative history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>of the earlier act and therefore have less probative force than legislative history, they are entitled to consideration as an expert opinion concerning its proper interpretation. <em>Boosee Corp. v. United </em>States, 411 F.2d 231 (5th Cir. 1969).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b649-3\">The following germane remarks were made by Senator Joe T. San Agust\u00edn during the debate on Bill No. 182:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b649-4\">. . . that a quick check of all the authorities of all the private corporations that we have on the books of the territorial government of Guam, the phrase: \u201chas the words to sue and be sued in its corporate name\u201d, period. The intent of all these particular phraseologies, Madame Speaker, was to preclude any suit, any claims against the \u201cauthorities\u201d or the public corporations from going beyond the \u201cauthorities\u201d to the government of Guam per-se . . . the Guam Educational Television Corporation Act has that- same phraseology but it\u2019s not exposed to the Government of Guam Claims Torts Act. The Telephone Authority has the same phraseology, but the government of Guam in its totality is not exposed to suit beyond the Authority. Commercial Port, the Airport Authority, Guam Power Authority, Guam Economic Development Authority, and for that matter, even the Guam Housing Corporation.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b649-5\">The Court finds that this evidences an intent that suits against G.P.A. should be without regard to the Government Claims Act.</p>\n    <p id=\"b649-6\">Administrative interpretations are also persuasive in determining statutory construction. The Court notes that:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b649-7\">A practical construction given by a statute by the public generally, as indicated by a uniform course of conduct over a considerable period of time, and acquiesced in and approved by a public official charged with the duty of enforcing the act, is entitled to great weight in the interpretation which should be given it, in case there is any ambiguity in its meaning serious enough to raise a reasonable doubt in any fair mind. <em>Hennessy v. Personal Finance Corp., </em>26 N.Y.S.2d 1072 (1941).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b649-8\">Cases cited by plaintiff indicate that in the past G.P.A. has acquiesced to suits outside the Government Claims Act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Defendant is only presently objecting to its amenability to such suits. Similarly, G.H.C., G.H.U.R.A. and G.T.A., government of Guam public corporations which may sue or be sued in their own corporate names, have also permitted suits without regard to the Government Claims Act.</p>\n    <p id=\"b650-5\">On final analysis, the Court concludes that G.P.A.\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity is not limited to the Government Claims Act. Therefore, defendant\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is DENIED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b650-6\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

We sit as an appellate court under authority of the Guam Code of Civil Procedure, Part I, Title I, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Chapter II, <em>and </em>Public Law 85-444, 85th Congress, approved June 4, 1958, 72 Stat. 178. The Trust Territory justices were assigned by the Chief Judge of the Ninth Judicial Circuit of the United States under the authority vested in him by Public Law 85-444.</p>\n    <p id=\"b52-3\">The appellant raises three points as grounds of appeal, namely, (1) that the fourth and crucial paragraph of the Island Court\u2019s findings of fact is contrary to and inconsistent with the evidence; (2) that the court erred in admitting over the plaintiff\u2019s objection a recapitulation or summary, admittedly made by the President of the defendant corporation, of the account between the parties containing many items running over a period from 1952 to 1955; and (3) that the court erred in its interpretation of the evidence and in assuming that the plaintiff presented its claims in two conflicting amounts.</p>\n    <p id=\"b52-4\">The paragraph of the findings of fact which the appellant complains of reads as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b52-5\"><em>\u201c4. </em>Defendant produced all invoices and cancelled checks showing payment in full for each invoice previous to the trial of this action. The total invoices and payments made exceeded' the amount testified to by witnesses for the plaintiff. Plaintiff has failed to show that defendant is indebted to plaintiff in any amount.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b52-6\">Counsel for the appellant objects especially to the statement, \u201cDefendant produced all invoices and cancelled checks showing payment in full for each invoice previous to the trial of this action.\u201d It is clear that the documents referred to were not introduced in evidence and counsel for the appellant claims in his closing brief that he \u201cwas not allowed to see those papers.\u201d This argument is too technical to be entitled to weight in view of Section 475 of the Guam Code of Civil Procedure, which provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b52-7\">\u201cSec. 475. Errors and defects and reversal of judgment. The court must, in every stage of an action, disregard any error, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>improper ruling, instruction, or defect, in the pleadings or proceedings which, in the opinion of said court, does not affect the substantial rights of the parties____\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b53-3\">While the word \u201cproduce\u201d as applied to documents is sometimes used in the sense of \u201cproduce, and offer in evidence,\u201d that is not its only possible meaning. Section 1939 of the Guam Code of Civil Procedure shows this clearly. It reads as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b53-4\">\u201cSec. 1939. Writings called for and inspected may be withheld. Though a writing called for by one party is produced by the other, and is thereupon inspected by the party calling for it, he is not obliged to produce it as evidence, in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b53-5\">Taken in the context of this case, the word \u201cproduced\u201d in the finding in question quite obviously means physically brought into the court room and made available for examination.</p>\n    <p id=\"b53-6\">The record does not bear out at all counsel for the appellant\u2019s claim that he was not allowed to see the papers in question. The only fair construction of repeated statements by the defendant\u2019s President on the witness stand and by the defendant\u2019s counsel is that they were offering her for examination on all the supporting documents she had brought with her and which she testified covered all the items in her recapitulation. Mr. Barrett, who represented the appellant at the trial as well as on this appeal, not only failed to inquire about these documents in his cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s President'but tried, to discourage their consideration, first, when the defendant\u2019s counsel, Mr. Phelan, started to offer them in evidence, and, second, when the court was inquiring into them. The record speaks for itself on this.</p>\n    <p id=\"b53-7\">\n      <em>Transcript, pp. 23-24-</em>\n    </p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b53-8\">\u201cMR.

PHELAN: Yes, I am offering this.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b54-6\">MR.

The issue is whether or not there was a thousand and some odd dollars owing as of October, 1955. I again state that the only material payments would be any payments made after that date.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b55-3\">The above quotations from the transcript give the impression that counsel for the plaintiff was then relying primarily on the theory that he had proved an account stated as of October 1955 and, therefore, did not wish to go into matters prior to that. The complaint, however, does not allege an account stated and the evidence that there ever was one or that any such amount was due in October, 1955, as the plaintiff claims, is not persuasive. On appeal their counsel has not argued that he proved an account stated, but whatever his reasons were for discouraging further examination of the supporting documents at the trial, we consider it unfair for him to now claim he \u201cwas not allowed\u201d to see them.</p>\n    <p id=\"b55-4\">In connection with his first two points, counsel for the appellant seems to have completely overlooked a well recognized exception to the general rule that the contents of documents must be proved by the originals. Section 1855 of the Guam Code of Civil Procedure provides in part as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b55-5\">\u201cSection 1855. Contents of writing, how proved. There can be no evidence of the contents of a writing, other than the writing itself, except in the following cases.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b55-6\">1. ...</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b55-7\">2. ...</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b55-8\">3. ...</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b55-9\">4. ...</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b55-10\">5. When the original consists of numerous accounts or other documents, which cannot be examined in court without great loss of time, and the evidence sought from them is only the general result of the whole____\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>The exception set forth in subdivision 5 of this section is in accord with and must be construed in the light of the usual common law exception applying to such a situation. The essential elements of this common law exception are stated as follows in Section 1230 of Wigmore on Evidence (Third Ed.):</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b56-5\">\u201cWhere a fact could be ascertained only by the inspection of a large number of documents made up of very <em>numerous detailed statements </em>\u2014 as, the net balance resulting from a year\u2019s vouchers of a treasurer or a year\u2019s accounts in a bank ledger \u2014 it is obvious that it would often be practically out of the question to apply the present principle by requiring the production of the entire mass of documents and entries to be perused by the jury or read aloud to them. The convenience of trials demands that other evidence be allowed to be offered, in the shape of the testimony of a competent witness who has perused the entire mass and will state summarily the net result. Such a practice is well established to be proper.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b56-6\">\u201cMost courts require, as a condition, that the mass thus summarily testified to shall, if the occasion seems to require it, be placed at hand in court, or at least be made accessible to the opposing party, in order that the correctness of the evidence may be tested by inspection if desired, or that the material for cross-examination may be available:</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b56-7\">1854, Bigelow, X, in....</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b56-8\">\u201cThe most commonly recognized application of this principle is that by which the state of <em>pecuniary accounts </em>or other business transactions is allowed to be shown by a witness\u2019 schedule or summary. So, also,....\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b56-9\">Under the circumstances in this case, involving an active account running oyer a period of years and including over two hundred (200) entries according to the recapitulation in question, we find no error in the court\u2019s admission of the recapitulation.</p>\n    <p id=\"b56-10\">There is a plain inconsistency between some of the figures in two (2) of the exhibits introduced by the plaintiff, which inconsistency was not explained by the evidence. This was a proper factor for the court to consider in de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>termining the reliability and accuracy of the plaintiff\u2019s records and computations. We find no error in the court commenting on this nor do we feel it imports any misinterpretation of the evidence. The plaintiff had plenty of opportunity to present to the trial court any explanation there might be for the inconsistency. The explanation which counsel for the appellant offers in his brief, that the inconsistency was due to an understandable error on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s own accountant, does little to strengthen his case.</p>\n    <p id=\"b57-3\">On the entire record we feel that the trial court was fully justified in finding that the plaintiff had not sustained the burden of proving that the defendant owed the plaintiff anything.</p>\n    <p id=\"b57-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

As we agree that the conviction must be reversed for failure of the prosecution to show that she was a common prostitute within the meaning of the vagrancy statute, supra, we do not consider the question of entrapment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b109-7\">This sordid story begins in early December, 1961. No evidence appears that the defendant at that time was other than a waitress employed at a club, where she was solicited by three Filipinos to have sexual relations with them for hire. Two of these subsequently testified at the trial and perjured themselves on two and possibly three material points (a) that they had not informed the police prior to the arrest of their appointment with the defendant; (b) that they had not been furnished with money by the police to pay to the defendant; and (c) that they had paid any money to the defendant. For the purpose of this opinion we rely upon police testimony.</p>\n    <p id=\"b109-8\">The Filipinos were known to Sgt. Ignacio for about a year, but he had never used them previously in vice work. In the early part of December they reported to him that they had solicited the defendant, but she refused to go with them on two separate occasions a week apart. On the third occasion she agreed to have sexual relations for $20 each and gave them a phone number which subsequently led to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>appointment at her house the night of December 19. This appointment was reported to the police who gave two of them $20 bills after taking down the serial numbers. The police then proceeded to watch the house. The Filipinos arrived and the defendant asked them to wait until her landlord was off the premises. She then had sexual relations with one who testified he gave her $20 of his own money, and she was in the process of having sexual relations with the second one, who similarly testified, when the police entered, took photographs, made the arrest, searched for the money and found none. The defendant said she had been doing this for about two weeks and the Filipinos had given her no money.</p>\n    <p id=\"b110-5\">We therefore have a situation where the defendant was not known to the police as a prostitute and there is no evidence of prostitution, except the acts on December 19, plus her statement that she had been doing this for about two weeks. Further, there appears to be no evidence that she accepted the solicitation of the Filipinos until she had refused such solicitation on at least two previous occasions. Her concern over the presence of her landlord further indicates that she was not running a house of prostitution.</p>\n    <p id=\"b110-6\">Was she a common prostitute on December 19,1961? The court below was at liberty to conclude that she had been paid by the Filipinos even though no money was found, but the statute does not refer to a prostitute but to a <em>common </em>prostitute. When the Penal Code of California was adopted in Guam, the construction placed upon its provisions by the courts of California were also adopted, <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>181 F.2d 577.</p>\n    <p id=\"b110-7\">It is only necessary to cite two late California cases to illustrate. While California cases subsequent to the adoption of the Penal Code of Guam are not controlling, they are persuasive especially when earlier cases are considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>in the later opinions. In <em>People v. Brandt, </em>306 P.2d 1069 (1956), the prosecution witness had testified to an act of sexual intercourse with the defendant prostitute. After pointing out that vagrancy is not an act, but a condition, the court stated:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b111-3\">Turning now to the alleged insufficiency of the evidence. Since common prostitution is undoubtedly a way of life or status, as already pointed out, appellant could not properly be convicted under the vagrancy statute, unless, in addition to the proven act of intercourse, there were attendant circumstances constituting a basis for finding that the practice was habitual. The incriminating circumstances were indeed meager. From the transcript it would appear that there were two women in the private home which Trotter visited, namely Mrs. McPherson and the appellant. Trotter had sexual intercourse with one of them. Aside from this, there was no proof that \u201cTina\u201d practiced prostitution as a business, or that the premises were regularly used for such purpose. Nor was evidence offered by which such facts could be inferred \u2014 the coming and going of men, the presence of paraphernalia, the bad reputation of the house .... The question here does not involve the undoubted right of the trial judge to weigh conflicting testimony. On the contrary, it is whether or not the appellant, by proof of one act of illicit intercourse in a house which may or may not have been a house of prostitution, can be convicted of vagrancy.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b111-4\"><em>People v. Daniel, </em>1686 A.2d Supp. 788, 337 P.2d 247 (1959) involved the construction of the words \u201ccommon drunkard.\u201d Cal. Penal Code 647, subd. 11; Guam Penal Code 647, subd. 9. The lower court had held this subdivision to be unconstitutional. The appellate court reversed and held that the words \u201ccommon\u201d and \u201cdrunkard\u201d had well defined meanings. We quote, p. 798:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b111-5\">\u201cThe dictionaries are in substantial accord on the definitions, although some accord to the word \u2018drunk\u2019 or \u2018drunkard\u2019 alone a meaning which would make the word \u2018common\u2019 superfluous. Ballantine\u2019s Law Dictionary, second edition (1948), defines drunkenness as \u2018that state or condition which inevitably follows from taking excessive quantities of an intoxicant. It is synonymous with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>inebriety and inebriation.\u2019 The same authority defines a \u2018common drunkard\u2019 as \u2018a person who drinks intoxicating liquor to excess with habitual frequency.\u2019 Words and Phrases defines a \u2018drunk\u2019 as \u2018a person who is under the influence of liquor to the extent that his passions are visibly excited, or his judgment is impaired by the liquor.\u2019 Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, unabridged, second edition, defines a \u2018drunkard\u2019 as \u2018one who habitually drinks strong liquors immoderately, for example, a toper or a sot.\u2019 The same dictionary defines the word \u2018drunk\u2019 as \u2018under the influence of an intoxicant, especially an alcoholic liquor, so that the use of the faculties is materially impaired. Synonym \u2014 inebriate.\u2019 The same dictionary defines the word \u2018common\u2019 as \u2018habitual or notorious, as a common cold or a common thief\u2019; also \u2018of frequent or ordinary occurrence.\u2019 The American College Dictionary defines the word \u2018common\u2019 as \u2018generally or publicly known, \u2014 notorious as a common cold; familiar, usual, as a common event.\u2019 It defines \u2018drunk\u2019 as \u2018a drunken person, intoxicated with or as with strong drink.\u2019 It defines a \u2018drunkard\u2019 as \u2018a person who is habitually or frequently drunk.\u2019 It states that the use of the word \u2018drunkard\u2019 connotes wilful indulgence to excess. The Oxford Universal Dictionary defines the word \u2018common\u2019 as \u2018generally known,\u2019 as for example, \u2018a common prostitute\u2019; also as \u2018ordinary, prevalent, frequent, or commonly.\u2019 It also defines the word \u2018drunkard\u2019 as \u2018one addicted to drinking, especially to excess, as an inebriate, a sot.\u2019 That dictionary also states that these words have been in common use since the sixteenth century. It defines the word \u2018drunken\u2019 as \u2018intoxicated, or habitually intemperate,\u2019 and the word \u2018drunkenness\u2019 as \u2018the habit of drinking to excess.\u2019 We do not see how any person who can read and has access to a dictionary could possibly fail to understand the meaning of the words, \u2018common drunkard.\u2019 Their common use and the availability of the dictionary definitions furnish everybody with the means of knowing exactly what they mean. They are certainly sufficient to warn every person of the danger which he may incur if he persistently and habitually gets drunk.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b112-5\">As pointed out, supra, we do not consider the question of entrapment, nor do we consider whether private rights were violated, but we must note that this case has an unwelcome odor about it when the Filipinos originated the alleged prostitution and were rejected, reported to the po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>lice and were apparently encouraged to continue their solicitation until they succeeded. It is the business of the police to prevent, not encourage, prostitution.

Abbate presiding, on August 6, 1979. The Territory was represented by Assistant Attorney General Paul Pohlen and the defendant was represented by Stephen Cronin. Defendant moved to suppress a written statement made on June 2, 1978, and oral statements allegedly made at a polygraph examination on September 13,1978.</p>\n    <p id=\"b683-7\">1. THE STATEMENT OF JUNE 2, 1978</p>\n    <p id=\"b683-8\">The written statement of Mr. Flores was taken after interrogation from approximately 10:30 p.m. on June 1, 1978, until 5:00 a.m. on June 2. During this time Mr. Flores was not in communication with any friends, relative or advisor, but solely limited to contact with two shifts of interrogating police officers. At the time of the interrogation, Mr. Flores was nineteen (19) years of age by less than two (2) months and, although he had been passed through further grades, the possessor of a fourth grade education.</p>\n    <p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Prior to this statement, Mr. Flores claims to have been physically abused and threatened by Detective Ulloa. This allegation is denied by Detective Ulloa. It is undisputed that Detective Ulloa was alone in the interrogation room with Mr. Flores prior to his making any inculpatory statement.</p>\n    <p id=\"b684-5\">Giving due weight to the age and intelligence of the accused, length of detention and interrogation, conditions of interrogation, and allegations of threats and physical abuse, it is the decision of the court that, in the totality of the circumstances, the Territory has not met its burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the statement of June 2, 1978, was freely and voluntarily given. It must, therefore, be suppressed. <em>Lego v. Twomey, </em>404 U.S. 477, 92 S.Ct. 619 (1972).</p>\n    <p id=\"b684-6\">2. ORAL STATEMENTS OF SEPTEMBER 13, 1978</p>\n    <p id=\"b684-7\">Pursuant to plea discussions with the prosecution, Mr. Flores arranged to take a polygraph examination through his counsel. The evidence is undisputed that the defense and prosecution agreed on nine (9) questions which would be asked Mr. Flores. The answers to these questions might be exculpatory, but they would not be inculpatory as they were phrased in terms of whether Mr. Flores\u2019 co-defendant had acted alone in committing the murder. It is also undisputed that Mr. Flores and his attorney were told that Mr. Flores\u2019 attorney could not be present during the examination as it would disrupt the polygraph process.</p>\n    <p id=\"b684-8\">In fact, additional inculpatory questions were asked of Mr. Flores by the police polygraph operator. After the polygraph examination, Mr. Flores was told he was lying, and the police conducted what they referred to as a \u201cpost-polygraph interview\u201d in the absence of counsel, during which Mr. Flores allegedly made certain oral admissions.</p>\n    <p id=\"b685-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Prior to the giving of the polygraph, Mr. Flores was given a \u201cmodified\u201d advice of rights form. Lieutenant Diego, the polygraph examiner, testified that the form stated that the results of the polygraph may be used, and that meant that the results might be used by the Attorney General\u2019s office in deciding to proceed with the case or not. No other advice of constitutional rights was given.</p>\n    <p id=\"b685-3\">The alleged statements must be suppressed for two reasons. First, the warnings were not in compliance with those mandated by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602 (1966). And in the absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, statements made at or after polygraph examination are not admissible against a defendant. <em>People v. Algien, 501 </em>P.2d 468 (Colo. <em>1972); Sparks v. State, </em>229 N.E.2d 642 (Ind. 1967); <em>Commonwealth v. Bennett, </em>264 A.2d 706 (Pa. 1970); <em>State v. Faller, </em>227 N.W.2d 433 (S.D. 1975).</p>\n    <p id=\"b685-4\">Second, under the facts of this case, it cannot be said that there was \u201can intentional abandonment of a known right or privilege\u201d <em>(Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023) in Mr. Flores not having his attorney present. Mr. Flores was told that his attorney could not be present while he cooperated and took a polygraph limited to nine (9) questions necessary to effect a deal with the prosecution. The police then expanded this into additional polygraph questions and a post-polygraph interrogation, all without the presence of his attorney. The Territory made no showing of an express waiver of counsel and, under these circumstances, none can be implied from the limited waiver given to answer nine (9) specific questions in the absence of counsel. The Territory has fallen far short of showing an intentional abandonment of the right to counsel. (See <em>Brewer v. Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 97 S.Ct. 1232 (1977).)</p>\n    <p id=\"b685-5\">For the foregoing reasons, defendant\u2019s motion request<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>ing suppression of all statements made on June 1 and 2, 1978, and September 13 is granted.</p>\n    <p id=\"b686-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

At this motion hearing before this Court on October 20th both sides presented oral arguments and the prosecution filed its memorandum in opposition to the Dismissal Motion.</p>\n    <p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Having duly deliberated on these matters, which were reserved for this later Decision, the Court denies the Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n    <p id=\"b388-5\">The indictment in this case was filed on May 7,1976. There has been no showing by Defendant that the <em>5% </em>month delay to date was intentional or prejudicial in some concrete way to his ability to prepare his case. This Court takes judicial notice of previous motions by Defendant which motions contributed to the pre-trial delay. The balancing test standards explicated in <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>92 S.Ct. 2182 (1972), and cited by this Court in <em>The People of the Territory of Guam v. Frank Rodney Reyes and Gordon Steve Clay, </em>5F-74, have not been shown by Defendant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b388-6\">Nor is Dismissal with Prejudice justified because of non-compliance with the orders of this Court relating to discovery and grand jury testimony. While we condemn late compliance, the prosecution did eventually comply, and we do not feel dismissal is appropriate at this juncture; the prosecution could re-indict, causing further delay. Defendant failed to show sufficient prejudice resulting from the delayed compliance.</p>\n    <p id=\"b388-7\">All courts are most reluctant to dismiss without prejudice or exclude the prosecution\u2019s use of the discovered evidence, but this Court will take such drastic action if there is further unjustified delay.</p>\n    <p id=\"b388-8\">Submit order.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The Interlocutory Decree of Divorce was entered in the Island Court of Guam on March 20, 1958 in favor of the appellee and denying the appellant\u2019s cross-complaint, and on April 3, 1958 an Order For Division Of Community Property was entered. Questions presented in this appeal are, briefly, whether or not the Island Court of Guam erred in refusing to dismiss the complaint at the close of the appellee\u2019s case; does the evidence sustain the judgment and are the findings supported by the evidence; was it error to refuse to appoint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>a receiver and order an accounting; was error committed in dividing the community property; was granting supersedeas error and an abuse of discretion; was the Court in error in not entering judgment for appellant; and lastly, in view of the entire record of this case, was the Court biased and prejudiced to such an extent as to deny to appellant a fair trial.</p>\n    <p id=\"b70-5\">This Court, after careful examination of the entire transcript of the evidence in this case, can find no prejudicial error in the trial of the case itself, nor can it find any justification for the charge made by counsel for the appellant that the Island Court was biased and prejudiced against the appellant and in favor of the appellee.</p>\n    <p id=\"b70-6\">It is the opinion of this Court that the Island Court erred, however, in including as community property, which was subsequently divided, the earnings and accumulations of the appellant while living separate and apart.</p>\n    <p id=\"b70-7\">\u201cThe disposition of the community property, and of the homestead, as above provided, is subject to revision on appeal in all particulars, including those which are stated to be in the discretion of the Court.\u201d Section 148, Guam Civil Code.</p>\n    <p id=\"b70-8\">\u201cThe earnings and accumulations of the wife, and of her minor children living with her or in her custody, while she is living separate from her husband, are the separate property of the wife.\u201d Section 169, Guam Civil Code.</p>\n    <p id=\"b70-9\">The supersedeas bond filed in the Island Court on May 13, 1958 is rather confusing to this Court as to its operation and effect. However, if it was the intention of the parties that this bond was filed as security for the payment by the appellee to the appellant, this Court feels that the bond should remain in full force and effect until the terms and conditions of a new order of the Island Court concerning the disposition of the community property are fully complied with and the bond exonerated.</p>\n    <p id=\"b70-10\">The Interlocutory Decree of Divorce entered on March 20, 1958 is hereby affirmed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b71-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>The Order For Distribution Of Community Property entered in the Island Court on April 3, 1958 is hereby set aside and the case remanded to that Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. We believe that an attempt should be made by the Island Court to determine summarily the amount of the appellant\u2019s separate property which has been inadvertently included as part of the community property so listed in said order.</p>\n    <p id=\"b71-3\">Due to his retirement, Judge Manibusan has taken no part in this opinion.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

In Appeal Case Civil No. 13-A the action was remanded to the Island Court with instructions to grant the present appellant a new trial in accordance with the opinion on that appeal,, which indicated that this appellant should be allowed to be fully heard on its defense (even though pleaded as a counter-claim and cross-complaint) of partial eviction. As a result of the new trial, the Island Court found there had been no partial eviction and entered judgment decreeing that all sums then on deposit in the Island Court which had been paid over pursuant to the orders of this Court to secure the rights of the parties be paid to the plaintiff-appellee, that the sublease in question had been forfeited, and that a writ of restitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>issue. The action is now before us on appeal from that judgment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b125-3\">The plaintiff-appellee was the lessor in a sublease agreement assigned to the present defendant-appellant covering portions of lots numbers 1040 and 1051 in Agana, Guam, on which the defendant-appellant or its assignor was to erect a store building. The sublease was for a period of ten (10) years less one (1) day, with provision for renewal for an additional term of ten (10) years under certain conditions, or for a lesser additional term under other conditions.</p>\n    <p id=\"b125-4\">At the new trial the defendant-appellant endeavored to prove two distinct partial evictions \u2014 one continuing since about the inception of the sublease based on an alleged error in the location of the wall between the plaintiffappellee\u2019s building and that of the defendant-appellant, and the other based on the alleged use of the joint parking lot by a tenant or tenants of the plaintiff-appellee for a used and new car business during the period from July 15, 1954, to mid-December 1955.</p>\n    <p id=\"b125-5\">So far as the alleged partial eviction from about the inception of the sublease is concerned, it is clear that the defendant-appellant acquiesced in the placing of the building in question and made no complaint whatever about it until long after the trouble arose about the parking lot and the sublease had already run several years. Although the rent had been paid for five (5) years in advance, at the inception of the sublease, we believe that any partial eviction based on the location of the plaintiff-appellee\u2019s building must be considered to have been waived by the conduct of the parties. See <em>Duncan v. Granas, </em>166 Cal. 41, 134 Pac. 979 (1913). We recognize, however, that in that case there was the additional element of payment of rent after the alleged partial eviction. In fact the parties seem to have been so friendly during the period of construction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>buildings and surfacing of the parking lot that they paid little attention to the exact terms of the sublease agreement. The provision with regard to the parking lot reads as follows : \u2014 \u25a0</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b126-5\">\u201c9. The parties hereto agree that the area between the buildings standing upon Lots Nos. 1040 and 1037, Agana, shall be used as a joint parking space for the convenience of the occupants of said buildings.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b126-6\">Yet it clearly appears from defendant\u2019s Exhibit 2 and the testimony concerning it, that .the plaintiff-appellee\u2019s building on Lot 1037 as actually built abutted immediately against the defendant-appellant\u2019s building on Lot 1040, and left no room for a parking lot at the point specified in the agreement. Instead the parties shared the cost of putting a hard top on a parking lot in front of the buildings, the defendant-appellant paying half the cost. Prior to and throughout the new trial all concerned seem to have acquiesced in considering this parking lot as the one covered by the sublease. We accordingly believe that it must be considered to have been substituted by mutual agreement for that described in the sublease agreement.</p>\n    <p id=\"b126-7\">The question of whether there was a substantial partial eviction from this substituted parking lot turns, in our opinion, on the correct interpretation of the provisions of the sublease with regard to the original parking lot, quoted above. The trial court made findings that the sublease \u201cgave defendant a right to share in the use of said parking lot and that defendant and its patrons had the use of said parking lot. That the parking lot was also used from time to time by other persons but that there were during the period complained of by defendant, sufficient empty parking spaces during business hours so as to accommodate any of the defendant\u2019s customers and employees.\u201d We feel, however, that those findings do not cover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the point at issue, and that the defendant-appellant was entitled to greater right in the parking lot than these findings indicate. It is well settled that a lease should be construed to give effect to the intention of the parties as shown in the lease and that, in arriving at this intention, the surrounding circumstances and the object in view and intended to be accomplished by the parties at the time, are to be considered. 32 Am.Jur., Landlord and Tenant, Section 127.</p>\n    <p id=\"b127-3\">The sublease in question here contained (in paragraph 4) an express acknowledgment by the sublessor that the sublessee was, at his own expense, constructing a store building upon the subleased premises and that it was the intent of the parties that the sublessee should have the use and enjoyment of said building as owner consistent with the sublessor\u2019s then existing leases. It also contained in paragraph 7 a covenant by the sublessor not to lease any additional units of the buildings upon Lots Nos. 1040 and 1051 to anyone in competition with or engaged in a like kind of business as the sublessee. The only reasonable inference is that the building in question was to be used for .business catering to the public. We believe that, under the proper construction of paragraph 9 of the sublease, quoted above, in the light of the objectives sought by the sublease and the conduct of the parties, the defendant-appellant was entitled not merely to share in the use of the parking lot for itself and its customers, but also to have the parking lot kept free from use other than for access to the buildings and for such parking as was normally incident to businesses carried on within the buildings, and not to have the parking lot itself used for carrying on business or as a space for dead storage or as a demonstration area.</p>\n    <p id=\"b127-4\">The evidence shows that the plaintiff-appellee, either directly or indirectly, authorized a tenant of its adjoining building, over the repeated objections of the defendant-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>appellant, to use this parking lot for buying and selling of automobiles, storage of used cars and equipment, and as a stand for its demonstrators. There is no conflict in the testimony as to such use from July 15, 1954, through September 1954, and such conflict as there is as to the period from October 1954 to mid-December 1955 relates to the part and proportion of the parking lot used for this automobile business, rather than to any showing that the lot was not itself used as a place of business for other than normal parking incident to a business carried on within the buildings in question. While it may be difficult to ascertain with a reasonable degree of certainty the exact extent to which this use of the parking lot damaged the defendant-appellant, it was clearly detrimental to the latter and its business and we believe was a substantial wrongful interference by the sublessor with the rights of its sublessee.</p>\n    <p id=\"b128-5\">We recognize that, according to the great weight of authority, an interference with a lessee\u2019s rights by his lessor which amounts to merely a constructive eviction will not relieve the lessee from the payment of the rent contracted for, unless he surrenders or abandons the leased premises, although generally recoupment of damages for breach of a covenant of quiet enjoyment is allowable in an action for the rent reserved. 32 Am.Jur., Landlord and Tenant, Sections 479 and 538. On the other hand it is generally accepted that a partial eviction by the lessor from a part of the premises will relieve the lessee from liability for future rents, and that the legal effect of such eviction from a part of the premises is to suspend the rent entirely, even though the lessee remains in occupancy of the remainder of the premises. 32 Am.Jur., Landlord and Tenant, Section 480; Skaggs v. Emerson (1875) 50 Cal. 3.</p>\n    <p id=\"b128-6\">It is difficult to reconcile all of the cases drawing a distinction between constructive eviction and an actual partial eviction and it is not in all cases clear whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>particular breach complained of has been considered as an actual partial eviction or a constructive eviction. As stated in 20 American Law Reports Annotated at page 1373:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b129-3\">\u201cIt has been said that it is extremely difficult to define with technical accuracy what is an eviction. The word \u2018eviction\u2019 was formerly used to denote an expulsion by the assertion of a paramount title, or by process of law. But that sort of an eviction is not necessary to constitute a suspension of the rent, because it is now well settled that, if a tenant loses the benefit of the enjoyment of any portion of the demised premises, by the act of the landlord, the rent is thereby suspended. Upton v. Townend (Eng.) supra.\u201d (The reference is to <em>Upton v. Townend </em>(1855) 17 C.B. 80, 139 Eng. Reprint, 976, 25 L.J.C.P.N.S. 44, 1 Jur. N.S. 1089, 4 Week. Rep. 56.)</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b129-4\">We believe that the present rule is correctly stated in <em>Holden v. Tidwell </em>(1913) 37 Okla. 553, 49 L.R.A. (N.S.) 369, 133 Pac. 54, Ann. Cas. 1915C 394, quoted in 20 A.L.R. at page 1374 as follows:\u2014</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b129-5\">\u201cOriginally an eviction was understood to be a dispossession of the tenant by some act of his landlord, or the failure of his title. Of late years it has come to include any wrongful act of his landlord which may result in an interference with the tenant\u2019s possession in whole or in part. The act may be one of omission as well as of commission. The rent is suspended by an eviction, because it is plainly unjust that the landlord should be permitted to collect it, while by his own act he deprives the tenant of the possession which is the consideration for it. But the landlord is not responsible for the actions of others lawfully done on their own premises. He is liable only for his own acts and for such acts of others as it was his duty to protect his tenant from.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b129-6\">See the entire section of the annotation concerning the tenant\u2019s right to claim partial actual eviction in 20 A.L.R. 1372 to 1378.</p>\n    <p id=\"b129-7\">It is well established that the appurtenances, including easements and servitudes, granted either expressly in the lease or by implication, are included in the leased premises which the tenant is entitled to the quiet possession and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>enjoyment of to the extent of such rights, even though they may be shared with others. 32 Am.Jur., Landlord and Tenant, Section 169, including the portion added following note 14 by the 1962 Cumulative Supplement to that volume, page 18; <em>Owsley v. Hamner </em>(1951) 36 Cal.2d 710, 227 P.2d 263, 24 A.L.R.2d 112 and the annotation following it in 24 A.L.R.2d.</p>\n    <p id=\"b130-5\">The closest case to the present one, which has come to our attention, is <em>Hamilton v. Graybill </em>(1907) 19 Misc. 521, 43 N.Y.Supp. 1079, cited with brief summary in 20 A.L.R. 1377. In that case it appears that a tenant had leased some rooms which had two entrances, which the court considered as appurtenances to the leased rooms. The tenant was actually and physically ousted and kept expelled from the use of one of these entrances. The court considered that this was not merely a constructive eviction from the rooms, but constituted an actual eviction from a part of the premises, which, though the tenant continued to occupy the rooms, had the effect of suspending the entire rent so long as the eviction endured.</p>\n    <p id=\"b130-6\">We are of the opinion that similarly here, the physical use of the parking lot as a place of business which the sublessor authorized in violation of the sublessee\u2019s right, as explained above, constituted an actual partial eviction and suspended the whole rent as such during the period of this partial eviction from July 15, 1954, to mid-December 1955. The rent for the first five (5) years of the sublease, including the period of this partial eviction, had been paid in advance. So, as far as the rent reserved in the sublease is concerned, as distinguished from any question of payment for use and occupation of the remainder of the premises, the rent was over-paid at the time of the bringing of this action, even though there may be question as to how much it was over-paid or how much of it, if any, the defendant-appellant might have been entitled to get back.</p>\n    <p id=\"b131-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>According to a number of authorities a tenant in such a situation is not even liable in quantum meruit for use and occupation of such part of the premises as he retains while the partial eviction continues, while others hold that he is entitled to a reduction in the rent, and it has been held that, where the rent has been paid in advance, the tenant may recover back the rent paid, or at least a proportionate part of it. The defendant-appellant has indicated in its brief and throughout these appeals a willingness to pay for the portion of the premises actually occupied and has evidenced its good faith by the payments made into the registry of this court to secure the rights of the parties. We believe that, under all the circumstances, the defendant-appellant was entitled to at least an allowance for such damages as it could show with reasonable certainty flowed from the partial eviction or if it could not so show the damages, then in any event, to an allowance for nominal damages. 32 Am.Jur., Landlord and Tenant, Sections 265 (especially notes 8, 13, and 14), 480 and 490; 20 A.L.R. 1369; 28 A.L.R. 1334; 64 A.L.R. 905.</p>\n    <p id=\"b131-3\">The whole theory on which a partial eviction is held to suspend the entire rent is that there can be no apportionment because the partial eviction is the wrongful act of the landlord himself and no one should be encouraged to disturb a tenant in the possession of that which, according to the policy of the law, he ought to protect and defend, and that a tenant should not be expected, at its peril, to estimate the exact amount due for partial occupancy under pain of possible further eviction through a proceeding for unlawful detainer. We believe that this theory applies equally to the present situation. It is a fundamental principle in equity that a person will not be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong. 19 Am.Jur., Equity, Section 471. It has also been held several times that forcible entry and detainer, or unlawful detainer, should not be allowed where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>that would be inequitable. See <em>Farmer v. Pitts </em>(Nebr. 1922) 187 N.W. 95, 24 A.L.R. 719, in which a judgment in forcible entry and detainer based on nonpayment of rent was reversed, the court stating at page 722 of 24 A.L.R.:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b132-3\">\u201cThe writer of this opinion cannot but be impressed with the idea, which seems to come from a reading of the record, that it was not the rent the lessor wanted, but rather a forfeiture of the lease contract. Now, the provision of the statute regarding a forcible entry and detention, as well as the provision in the lease as to the nonpayment of the rent, is for the security of such rental to the lessor, not for the purpose of giving him an undue advantage and permitting him unjustly to obtain a forfeiture of the lease.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b132-4\">Also: <em>Abrams v. Watson </em>(1877) 59 Ala. 524, cited and quoted from in 16 A.L.R. 444; <em>Humphrey v. Humphrey </em>(1950) 254 Ala. 395, 48 So.2d, 424, 31 A.L.R.2d 315, and the annotations following it in A.L.R.2d.</p>\n    <p id=\"b132-5\">The plaintiff-appellee by its own wrong having created this uncertainty as to what deduction should be made from the rent already paid and therefore, as to the period for which the defendant-appellant should equitably be considered to have paid, we believe the plaintiff-appellee\u2019s right to relief through the summary procedure of unlawful detainer was barred until such time as the allowance for the partial eviction was either agreed upon or adjudicated and, if it then developed that any rent was in default, a proper notice was given in accordance with Section 1161 of the Guam Code of Civil Procedure specifying the correct amount due.</p>\n    <p id=\"b132-6\">It accordingly follows that the plaintiff-appellee was not entitled to recover possession of the property at the time it brought this action, and therefore is not entitled to recover any rent in this action for unlawful detainer.</p>\n    <p id=\"b132-7\">\u201cThe primary purpose of such an action is for the recovery of the possession of the property. The recovery of rent is a mere incident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>to the main object. . . . When the main object of the action fails, the incidents fall with it.\u201d <em>Markham v. Fralik </em>(1934) 2 Cal.2d, 221, 227.</p>\n    <p id=\"b133-3\">This leaves the question, however, of how the monies, which have been paid into the Registry of the District Court pursuant to the order of this Court to secure the rights of the parties, should be distributed. In order to avoid circuity of action, it is believed that these should be divided in this action on the basis of the amounts due for either rent or use and occupation and the costs in this action. We have already indicated in our former opinion in Appeal Case Civil No. 13-A that, under the circumstances, the defendant-appellant has an obligation to pay, upon a quantum meruit basis, for use and occupation of such part of the premises as it retained during the period of the partial eviction. We believe, however, that this cannot equitably and fairly be held to exceed the rent stipulated in the lease, less an allowance for the partial eviction, and that for the period subsequent thereto the rent should be merely that provided in the lease, and that the defendant-appellant should be allowed its costs out of the sums deposited. The effect of the trial court\u2019s judgment and the \u201corder for payment\u201d pursuant to it, which recited that it was a special order pursuant to Section 942 of the Guam Code of Civil Procedure, has been to allow the plaintiffappellee, because of the supposed forfeiture of the sublease, an increase of about eighty percent (80%) above the rent stipulated, for a considerable period following the alleged default in the rent. We consider this inequitable and that in the distribution of the funds now on hand sufficient should be allowed the defendant-appellant (in addition to the other allowances discussed herein) to counterbalance this payment in excess of the rent stipulated in the sublease so as not to allow the plaintiff-appellee to profit from its own wrong.</p>\n    <p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>We consider that the defendant-appellant has failed to show with reasonable certainty what its damages were flowing from the partial eviction, but that even under these circumstances it is entitled, as stated above, to an allowance of nominal damages, which we fix at one dollar ($1.00) a month, for the period from July 15,1954, to December 15, 1955, or a total of seventeen dollars ($17.00), from the rent stipulated.</p>\n    <p id=\"b134-5\">The judgment of the Island Court of Guam, entered May 6, 1960 in its Civil Case 13-58, is hereby set aside. The funds now held in this action in the Registry of the District Court of Guam are ordered transferred to the Registry of the Island Court of Guam and this action is remanded to the Island Court of Guam with the following instructions :\u2014</p>\n    <p id=\"b134-6\">A. To enter judgment for the defendant Fashions, Incorporated, with costs.</p>\n    <p id=\"b134-7\">B. To divide the funds now in the Registry of this Court in such a manner as to allow the plaintiff, Pacific Insurance Associates, Ltd., out of all funds distributed through the Registry of the Court in this action, a total (including the $1,750.00 ordered on March 11, 1960, paid to the plaintiff pursuant to stipulation of counsel and the $6,636.28 ordered paid to the plaintiff pursuant to the judgment herein set aside) of only the amount stipulated as due for rent in the sublease in question from the time of the alleged default in payment of rent up to the time of the order making the division of the funds now on hand, less $17.00, and further less the taxable costs of the defendant Fashions, Incorporated, in this action, and then to give the balance to the defendant Fashions, Incorporated.</p>\n    <p id=\"b134-8\">Due to his death, Judge Gilmartin did not take part in this opinion.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Section 273(a) of the Penal Code of Guam provides:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b102-13\"><em>Contributing. </em>Any person who commits any act or omits the performance of any duty, which act or omission causes a child to become in need of the care and protection of the Juvenile Court, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, may be tried for such offense in the Juvenile Court, and upon conviction may be punished by a fine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>not exceeding $500, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b103-3\">In his appeal the defendant contends (a) that the age of the minor was not shown; and (b) that under the law of Guam an adult cannot contribute to the delinquency of a minor who at the time of the offense had been declared a juvenile delinquent. Neither contention is tenable.</p>\n    <p id=\"b103-4\">The prosecution failed to make inquiry as to the age of the minor, but an order of the Juvenile Court was produced showing that the minor had been born September 20, 1945. The defendant then proceeded to show that the minor on many occasions had been before the Juvenile Court, was currently a ward of the Juvenile Court when the offense took place. This was done in furtherance of the defense contention that an adult cannot in Guam be guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor if the minor was a delinquent at the time. The defendant relies upon the California statute which is not the same as Guam\u2019s.</p>\n    <p id=\"b103-5\">While such statutes, being penal in nature, are to be strictly and precisely construed as a general rule, <em>they are not to be construed in such a way as to aid in their evasion, </em>31 Am.Jur. 344.</p>\n    <p id=\"b103-6\">It is only necessary to cite the general law in this type of case to indicate that while the courts have differed on the question as to whether the minor must have been a juvenile delinquent at the time or have been declared a juvenile delinquent prior to the filing of the charge of contributing, there is uniformity on the question of contributing when juvenile delinquency exists:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b103-7\"><em>Necessity of Delinquency or Dependency of Minor. </em>\u2014 The general rule is that it is not necessary to a prosecution for contributing to the delinquency or dependency of a minor that the minor shall have been delinquent or dependent prior to the alleged acts or conduct of the defendant, although there is authority to the contrary. A finding or adjudication in a separate proceeding that a minor is delinquent is not a condition precedent to the mainte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>nance of a prosecution for contributing to the delinquency of the minor, where the affidavit filed against the one charged with so contributing and the evidence on his trial shows that the minor is delinquent.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b104-5\">Under some statutes, however, the jurisdiction of the juvenile court must have attached to the minor before the conviction of another for contributing to the minor\u2019s delinquency, or the minor must actually have been adjudged delinquent before the prosecution of the accused, 31 Am. Jur., pp. 345 and 346.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b104-6\">It would be absurd to hold that an adult cannot contribute to the delinquency of a minor who is in the process of being reformed after having been declared a juvenile delinquent. We do not care to indulge in any absurdity.</p>\n    <p id=\"b104-7\">The remaining question gives us greater concern. This appellate division does not have a rule similar to Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which provides that plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court, but as this court is bound by the Federal Rules we should probably consider plain error. It was alleged in the amended information that the defendant \u201cassisted a minor in the making of fictitious checks.\u201d The evidence was and the court so found that the defendant had filled in and signed the forged checks, then induced the minor to pass them at two stores. Section 476, Penal Code of Guam, includes the offenses of making, uttering, passing and publishing forged checks in one section with the same penalty, but making and uttering are usually considered separate and distinct offenses. The defendant did not include the variance in his motion to dismiss at the close of the government\u2019s case, Tr. p. 10, nor has he contended for error here. We therefore hold that in the circumstances of this case we need not note plain error. The making and passing of these checks was part of one continuous transaction. The defendant did not contend that he was sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>prised. The minor was present when the checks were filled in and an adult could have been held jointly responsible for the making of the forged checks. The defendant could have been held jointly responsible for the passing. We affirm.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

MANUEL CRUZ CRUZ, Defendant</parties>\n  <docketnumber id=\"A7p\">Civil Case No. 910-78</docketnumber>\n  <court id=\"AVH\">Superior Court of Guam</court>\n  <decisiondate id=\"b676-13\">July 26, 1979</decisiondate>\n  <opinion type=\"majority\">\n    <author id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>ABBATE, <em>Presiding Judge</em></author>\n    <p id=\"b677-5\">DECISION AND ORDER</p>\n    <p id=\"b677-6\">This action came before the Court for trial on May 31, 1979. David Shapiro appeared on behalf of the plaintiff and Frank Lujan appeared on behalf of the defendant. The matter was heard before the Honorable Paul J. Abbate and decision was reserved.</p>\n    <p id=\"b677-7\">On February 28, 1977, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into a Funeral Security Plan contract. This plan provided for the defendant or a member of his family a casket plus funeral services. The value of the above-mentioned casket and funeral service was approximately $1,450.00. Subsequently, after making $160 in payments, the defendant defaulted on the agreement. Shortly following the death of Maria T. Cruz (wife of defendant), the plaintiff approached the defendant concerning possible funeral arrangements for his wife. The plaintiff was willing to provide a casket along with funeral services for the value of the original contract less the $160 received. So the plaintiff was offering to provide the funeral for about $1,290.00. The defendant, however, wanted a more expensive casket ($350 more) than that covered in the original plan. The defendant did not manifest any desire for increased services. Under the original plan services amounted to $900.00. Eventually, the plaintiff acquired $500 from the defendant and the defendant\u2019s signature on a contract for a $2,775 funeral. The above contract provided for a $900 casket with $1,875 in services.</p>\n    <p id=\"b677-8\">The defendant signed the second contract without reading it as he is unable to read due to lack of formal educa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>tion. Consequently, the defendant signed the second contract believing the contents to be something different than what they actually were. The defendant was under the mistaken impression that he was contracting for the services offered in the original plan, which had a cost of $900.00.</p>\n    <p id=\"b678-5\">The holding of the Court is that the contract, entered into by the plaintiff and the defendant on November 21, 1978, be reformed to express the true intention of the parties. Accordingly, the defendant should not bear the extra cost for the services indicated in the second contract. Instead, the defendant is liable for the services offered in the original plan.</p>\n    <p id=\"b678-6\">Guam\u2019s Civil Code, \u00a7 3899, lists various situations in which a contract may be reformed or revised to express the intention of the parties. The three situations listed are fraud, mutual mistake, and a mistake of one party, which the other at the time knew or suspected.</p>\n    <p id=\"b678-7\">The basis for reformation in this case is the mistake of one party which resulted in a contract which does not express the intention of the parties. At the time the plaintiff entered into the second contract with the defendant, he knew or should have known that the latter was under the mistaken impression that the only difference in the original and the later plan was a change of caskets. The more than 100% increase in the funeral service cost was solely attributable to the plaintiff\u2019s actions. The defendant expressed a desire only for a more expensive casket and he believed that this aspect of the contract would be the only significant deviation from the original contract.</p>\n    <p id=\"b678-8\">Being illiterate, aged, subject to obvious emotional infirmities, and inexperienced in business and financial matters, it was apparent that the defendant would be unable to ascertain that he was signing a document which did not represent his true intentions and agreement with the plaintiff.</p>\n    <p id=\"b679-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>In addition, in a similar situation it was determined that the aggrieved party may be said to have executed the contract through \u201cunconscious ignorance\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1577 of the Civil Code concerning mistake of fact. <em>Moore v. Copp, </em>119 Cal. 429 (1897).</p>\n    <p id=\"b679-3\">For the reasons given above, the Court hereby orders that the contract of November 21,1978, between the plaintiff and the defendant be reformed in the following manner:</p>\n    <p id=\"b679-5\">U.S. metal casket (open) $ 900.00</p>\n    <p id=\"b679-6\">Service 900.00</p>\n    <p id=\"b679-7\">Grand Total $1,800.00</p>\n    <p id=\"b679-8\">Less pre-paid payment (160.00)</p>\n    <p id=\"b679-9\">Less down payment (500.00)</p>\n    <p id=\"b679-10\">Unpaid Balance $1,140.00</p>\n    <p id=\"b679-11\">It is SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

(\u201cSinger\u201d) was negotiating with the other defendants to enter into a contract for certain purposes, \u201cincluding more particularly the management, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>velopment, maintenance, and operation of the water resources and water systems of the Territory of Guam . . . on or before September 15, 1975,. . . .\u201d Plaintiff contended that the contract was for construction of public works within the meaning of Government Code, \u00a7 10001.5, was in excess of $2,500, and did not comply with Government Code, \u00a7 10001.6. The complaint prayed for a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction enjoining defendants from entering into the contract.</p>\n    <p id=\"b447-3\">Not only was the temporary restraining order denied, but the Superior Court of Guam granted an order dismissing the complaint without leave to amend and the action was dismissed with prejudice. In its decision, the Superior Court concluded that \u201cSection 10001.6 of the Government Code of Guam is applicable to projects under Department of Public Works but not to Public Utility Agency of Guam.\u201d It further found that the particular provisions of \u00a7 21204 were controlling.</p>\n    <p id=\"b447-4\">The deposition of defendant Paulino indicates that the contract was executed on either September 12th or 15th, 1975, prior to both the dates of the decision and the order of dismissal. Inasmuch as the complaint prays for an injunction against defendants from entering into a contract that was executed shortly either before or after the complaint was filed, it would appear that the matter before this Court has been mooted insofar as the relief prayed for is concerned.</p>\n    <p id=\"b447-5\">Subsequent to the hearing on appeal before this Court, counsel for defendants submitted copies of documents entered into between \u201cSinger\u201d and the Government of Guam cancelling the foregoing contract, thus further mooting the issue on appeal.</p>\n    <p id=\"b447-6\">Because of the mootness of the issue, the appeal is dismissed. See <em>Super Tire Engineering Co. v. McCorkle, </em>490 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>F.2d 911 (3rd Cir., 1972), for a discussion of the mootn\u00e9ss problem.</p>\n    <p id=\"b448-5\">In dismissing this appeal for mootness, we do not express an opinion as to the propriety of the action of the Superior Court in dismissing with prejudice plaintiff\u2019s complaint without leave to amend, nor do we express our approval or disapproval of that Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Tom Woo, </em>181 Cal. 315.</p>\n    <p id=\"b457-3\">The only finding by the trial court in this matter was that the defendant was guilty of involuntary manslaughter. In order to find such guilt, the trial court had to find that the defendant was driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor and by failing to yield the right-of-way to an approaching vehicle when making a left turn in or near an intersection. Sections 23405 and 23126, Government Code of Guam, and \u00a7\u00a7 192(3) (b) and 193(4), Penal Code of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b457-4\">The evidence more than supports the conclusion of the trial court that the defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident. Not only did the defendant\u2019s passenger in his vehicle testify that the defendant had been drinking, but two police officers who investigated the accident<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> testified that, in their opinion, the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. A review of the officers\u2019 testimony prior to giving that opinion reveals sufficient personal observation to form the basis of such an opinion.</p>\n    <p id=\"b457-5\">The appellant argues at length that error was committed by the trial court by admitting the results of the device<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> used to test the defendant for blood alcohol content. It is also argued that the trial court erred in allowing Dr. Park, a pathologist, to testify about anything other than the cause of the death of the driver of the car struck by the defendant\u2019s automobile.</p>\n    <p id=\"b458-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>There is no way in knowing what, if any, weight the trier of fact gave to the testimony of Dr. Park, or of the results of the device which tested the defendant\u2019s breath. The transcript of Dr. Park\u2019s testimony about the effect of alcohol on the human body boils down to one basic expression of opinion.

Therefore, that opinion is competent evidence.</p>\n    <p id=\"b458-7\">It is also the finding of this court that introduction into evidence of the result of the Omicron Intoxilyzer was not error.

Judge Perez did not hear oral argument in this case but it was stipulated that he should participate in the final determination. We affirm.</p>\n    <p id=\"b186-11\">Alvin David Faria, hereinafter \u201chusband,\u201d brought an action against Mary Ellen Faria, hereinafter \u201cwife,\u201d for a divorce. The divorce was granted to the wife on her cross-complaint. In distributing the community property the Court ordered that the property should be equally divided and that an accountant, agreeable to the parties, should be appointed by the Court to determine the interest of the plaintiff in the business known as Sno-White as of May 31, 1967. In due course an accountant was appointed and a determination was made that the partnership interest of the husband was worth $13,156.25 as of May 31, 1967. One-half of this amount was awarded to the wife after the husband had borrowed the necessary amount to pay her in full. It is to be noted that the wife had independent knowledge of the value of the business as she had been employed by the business. The Court\u2019s order was entered November 2, 1966. Under date of December 20, 1966, the wife moved to have the order set aside upon the ground that the husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>had actually sold his partnership interest to his brother partner for an amount in excess of the value found by the accountant. As noted, the Court refused to set the order aside after hearing evidence.</p>\n    <p id=\"b187-3\">In attempting to set aside the order the wife completely overlooked certain facts of partnership existence. In the first place, she had no right to a share in the partnership. As pointed out in <em>Burnet v. Leininger, </em>285 U.S. 136, any agreement between husband and wife could not make the wife a member of the partnership. \u201cThat result could not be achieved without the consent of the other partner or partners, and there is no finding of such consent.\u201d This was a case in which the husband and wife attempted to split income for income tax purposes by having the husband agree that he would pay one-half of the partnership income to the wife and, in turn, the wife would assume one-half of his partnership liabilities.</p>\n    <p id=\"b187-4\">In the second place, the purchase by the brother of the husband\u2019s partnership interest was not an arm\u2019s length transaction. It was based upon the peculiar relationships existing and although the wife was paid in full by the husband, the obligation of the brother to pay the husband involved credit extended ,to the brother. In this type of transaction there is also the latent possibility that a brother would be more considerate in paying more than the actual value. In any event, it is difficult to see why the wife should not be bound by the original determination.</p>\n    <p id=\"b187-5\">In the third place it must be recognized that the husband gave up more than the money involved. He was a partner in a going business which had provided him with a managerial income plus profits from the operation of the business. Under the terms of his sale to the brother, his managerial salary was reduced and his employment limited to the time necessary to train a successor. We entirely agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>the Island Court that .there is no basis for setting its order aside and, as noted above, we affirm.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Penalty. Gambling is defined as a contract between two or more persons by which they agree to play by certain rules at cards, dice, or other contrivances, and that one shall be the winner and the other or others the loser or losers of money or other objects. Every person who gambles is guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall upon conviction by a court of proper jurisdiction be punished by a fine of not more than $100 or by imprisonment not exceeding 3 months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. <em>Wagering on cockfights is excepted from the provisions of this section only where persons wagering are present in person at a licensed cockpit and are 18 years of age or above. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b194-13\">The contention of the People is that by including the italicized exception as to cockfights, the Legislature in tended to cover all types of wagering. On oral argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>the Island Attorney conceded that in the absence of the cockfight exception, wagering on the outcome of a prize fight would not be covered.</p>\n    <p id=\"b195-3\">At the outset we are confronted with the fact that this statute does not appear to have been taken from any other jurisdiction but appears to have been adopted during the Naval Administration. In response to a question, Chief Judge Perez pointed out that while boxing exhibitions were common during the Naval Administration, he had never heard of any prosecution for wagering on the outcome. The use of the words \u201ccards, dice, or other contrivances\u201d would appear to indicate that the prohibition was limited to the use of physical things in the contract. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Second Edition, defines, in part, a contrivance as \u201cA mechanical device; an appliance.\u201d In <em>Hannifin v. United States, </em>248 F.2d 173 (9 Cir. 1957), the Court had before it the construction of a Federal statute which prohibited the movement in interstate commerce of mechanical devices. The machines in question were ordered forfeited by the United States District Court. In reversing, the Court pointed out that while the forfeited machines were clearly gambling devices, they were not devices which were covered by the description in the Federal statute and that \u201cA statute whereby a man may be deprived of his personal property by way of punishment should be construed with strictness;\u201d.</p>\n    <p id=\"b195-4\">We are of the view that the exception as regards cockfights in Section 330 may not be construed as covering all types of wagering and that therefore the Island Court was correct in dismissing. We affirm.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The land was sold before the trial court discovered the error and vacated the decree. It was agreed between the parties the buyer was a bona fide purchaser relying on the certificate of title and the court was asked to decide the case on the merits with the prevailing party to be awarded the sale proceeds in lieu of the land. The court held for the appellees. We affirm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the result but remand for entry of judgment restating the reasons for the judgment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b241-3\">The appellees (Reyes) petitioned to register title in themselves to Lot 3269, Ordot, Sinajana, Guam. The appellants (Taitano, Perez and Jose and Jesus Guevara) filed a cross-petition ,to register title in themselves to Lot 3269-R4, Ordot. Manuel and Elena. Sab\u00edan filed for registration of title to Lot 3269-4, Ordot. The erroneous decree entered due to the misunderstanding held the Sablans to be owners in fee of Lot 3269-4 and the appellants to be owners of Lot No. 3269-R4. The appellees were denied relief by the decree.</p>\n    <p id=\"b241-4\">On the Reyes motion to modify, the court vacated its decree as to Lot No. 3269-R4. This lot was sold by Vicente Cepeda and Fred Arceo to Ton-Yung Enterprises, Inc., for what appears from the record to be the sum of $400,000. The buyer paid into the Island Court registry $45,440.00 as the amount then due on the buyer\u2019s promissory note.</p>\n    <p id=\"b241-5\">After hearings, wherein the parties agreed the court should retain jurisdiction to determine entitlement to the proceeds of sale, the Island Court held that the appellees were the owners of Lot No. 3269-R4 and all proceeds of the sale to Ton-Yung Enterprises, Inc., paid to them. . . .</p>\n    <p id=\"b241-6\">This immediately raises the problem of jurisdiction. Section 82, Code of Civil Procedure, limits the Island Court\u2019s jurisdiction to claims not exceeding $5,000.00. Section 738 of the Code of Civil Procedure confers jurisdiction on the Island Court to try quiet title or adverse claims to real estate. Section 1157.5 authorizes the Island Court to entertain land title registration cases. The present case was no longer a land registration matter in its second posture after issuance of the decree upon which title was granted.</p>\n    <p id=\"b241-7\">We agree with the trial court that the controversy was ownership of Lot 3269-R4 and that Section 738 gave jurisdiction even though the judgment must provide that money in substantial excess of the court\u2019s jurisdiction is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>required ,to be paid out. This recital of the jurisdictional problem, not raised in the trial court, is necessary to permit evaluation of the conflicting ownership claims.</p>\n    <p id=\"b242-5\">The court below found from the evidence the appellee Reyes \u201chas been in possession of said property and has been paying taxes since August, 1918.\u201d The court applied to this finding, Guam Civil Code of Procedure, Section 1963, sub (11) that possession presumes ownership. That possession of real property is \u201cprima facie ownership\u201d is a novel and perhaps oversimplified method of determining real property ownership when there are conflicting claims. Because the action necessarily proceeded upon the grant of jurisdiction by Section 738 then the determination of the controversy must be made in accordance with Section 749 of the Guam Code. This requires a showing of \u201cactual, exclusive and adverse possession of such property continuously for twenty years.\u201d Possession, without more, even though it gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of ownership, does not meet .the statutory requirements. The court did not find the possession of Reyes was adverse to either the appellants or to all others. We examined the record to determine the question.</p>\n    <p id=\"b242-6\">The parties agreed the original recorded owner was Cecilio Guevara. He died in 1926 and .the appellants are his heirs. Appellee Vicente Reyes purchased the land in 1918 and with his bride moved onto it in 1922. Although no deed was contained in the record none was needed. The circumstances surrounding the sale and the departure of the owner from the land were alon\u00e9 sufficient to support .the conclusion there was a sale.</p>\n    <p id=\"b242-7\">The fact of a sale, furthermore, is only a fact supporting the conclusion the possession, use and occupancy of the land for more than twenty years was adverse to the owner of record and to .the heirs of the original owner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>who are the appellants. It must be concluded as a matter of law the appellees established their claim of ownership \u25a0in accordance with the requirements of Section 749. It is not necessary to recite all the evidence in the record to support this conclusion, but only to say it is adequate.</p>\n    <p id=\"b243-3\">Appellants\u2019 brief and counsel\u2019s argument to this court complained that the trial court either did not consider or at least made no findings in support of the judgment in accordance with the requirements of Sections 321, 324, and 325, Code of Civil Procedure, which pertain to the five year statute of limitations barring actions when title is claimed by adverse possession. The statutory provisions of Section 325 requiring for the five-year adverse possession, enclosure or cultivation and improvement, is not specifically applicable. Adverse possession that is hostile to the record owner, together with the other elements set forth in the statute need not meet the five-year statutory requirements of enclosure, cultivation, and payment of taxes.</p>\n    <p id=\"b243-4\">The record established the basic elements of adverse possession to the effect that the occupancy was open and notorious; hostile to the recorded title; under color of title or claim of right; continuous and uninterrupted for the specified period, which in this instance was twenty years.</p>\n    <p id=\"b243-5\">The judgment of the Island Court is remanded for entry of judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

When the appellant\u2019s car stopped and he was asked for his driver\u2019s license, he got out of his car and was staggering so badly he could hardly stand.

This provides that, \u201cin all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to ... an impartial jury . . .\u201d U.S. Const. Amend. VI. Several procedural safeguards have been established in order to insure the defendant of a fair trial. A defendant may (1) seek a change in venue, (2) seek a continuance, (3) question the prospective jurors during voir dire as to whether they were influenced by the pre-trial publicity, (4) challenge the jurors for cause, (5) exercise his peremptory challenges, (6) challenge the jury panel, (7) obtain precautionary instructions from the Judge. <em>Ignacio v. People of the Territory of Guam, </em>413 F.2d 513, 517 (1969).</p>\n    <p id=\"b589-9\">Thus, a change of venue is not the exclusive procedural mechanism which can be utilized to assure the defendant of a fair trial. Rather, it appears that in only one case has the Supreme Court held that only a change of venue would secure an impartial trial for the defendant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b589-10\">It was in <em>Rideau v. Louisiana, </em>373 U.S. 723, 83 S.Ct. 1417 (1963), that the Supreme Court \u201cexplicitly held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>only a change of venue was constitutionally sufficient to assure the kind of impartial jury that is guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Groppi v. Wisconsin, </em>400 U.S. 511, 91 S.Ct. 490, 493 (1971). In that case, a moving picture with sound track had been made of an interview in jail between the sheriff and the defendant. In response to leading questions by the sheriff, the defendant admitted in detail the commission of the robbery, kidnapping and murder. This film was then televised three times to tens of thousands of people in the parish. The Court found that it was a denial of due process of law \u201cto refuse the request for a change of venue, after the people of Calcasieu Parish had been exposed repeatedly and in depth to the spectacle of Rideau personally confessing in detail to crimes with which he was later to be charged.\u201d <em>Rideau v. Louisiana, </em>83 S.Ct. at 1419.</p>\n    <p id=\"b590-5\">Absent an extreme factual situation akin to Rideau, a change of venue is not constitutionally mandated as the only procedure available to protect defendant\u2019s right to an impartial trial. However, as noted, it is one of the procedures that can be utilized to obtain a fair trial. In ruling on a motion for change of venue based on pre-trial publicity, the trial court must determine whether the accused has been prejudiced in his right to a fair trial. Two tests have been applied. The first test is applicable in those cases in which the circumstances are inherently lacking in due process. In those instances, the Supreme Court has authorized a change of venue without a showing of actual prejudice. Illustrative of the application of the first test are the cases of <em>Estes v. State of Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532, 85 S.Ct. 1628 (1965), and <em>Sheppard v. Maxwell, </em>384 U.S. 350, 86 S.Ct. 1507 (1966).</p>\n    <p id=\"b590-6\">In <em>Estes v. State of Texas, </em>supra, certain pre-trial proceedings and portions of the actual trial were televised. The Court noted that:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b591-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Where pre-trial publicity of all kinds has created intense public feeling which is aggravated by the telecasting or picturing of the trial the televised jurors cannot help but feel the pressures of knowing that friends and neighbors have their eyes upon them. <em>Estes v. State of Texas, </em>85 S.Ct. at 1634.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b591-3\">In finding that the probability of prejudice was sufficiently great to find the trial inherently lacking in due process without a showing of actual jury prejudice, the Court stated:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b591-4\">It is true that in most cases involving claims of due process deprivations we require a showing of identifiable prejudice to the accused. Nevertheless, at times a procedure employed by the State involves such a probability that prejudice will result that it is deemed inherently lacking in due process. <em>Estes v. State of Texas, </em>85 S.Ct. at 1633.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b591-5\">In <em>Sheppard v. Maxwell, </em>384 U.S. 350, 86 S.Ct. 1507 (1966), the Supreme Court indicated that the facts warranted either a continuance or change of venue without a showing of actual jury prejudice. The circumstances of <em>Sheppard </em>were as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b591-6\">For months the virulent publicity about Sheppard and the murder had made the case notorious. Charges and counter-charges were aired in the news media besides those for which Sheppard was called to trial. In addition, only three months before trial, Sheppard was examined for more than five hours without counsel during a three-day inquest which ended in a public brawl. The inquest was televised live from a high school gymnasium seating hundreds of people. <em>Sheppard v. Maxwell, </em>86 S.Ct. at 1518.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b591-7\">In the case at bar, defendant contends that the citizens of Guam have been prejudiced by exposure to publicity concerning the possible decline of Japanese tourism, the succession of defense attorneys that were appointed and excused, the article captioned \u201cPaper Says D\u00e9la Rosa Admitted to Killings\u201d (PDN, May 24, 1978); the article captioned \u201cSuspect Possessed Watch, Jewelry, of Murder Victim\u201d (PDN, May,5, 1978); the article stating that de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>fendant may be responsible for the Texiera murders, (PDN, April 25, 1978); and the article concerning defendant\u2019s past criminal record (PDN, April 28, 1978).</p>\n    <p id=\"b592-5\">This pre-trial publicity does not approach the magnitude of the prejudicial publicity condemned in either <em>Rideau </em>or <em>Estes </em>and <em>Sheppard. </em>The articles, on the whole, are factual accounts. The Supreme Court in <em>Murphy v. Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 95 S.Ct. 2031, 2036 (1975), refused to hold \u201cthat juror exposure to information about a state defendant\u2019s prior convictions or to news accounts of the crime with which he is charged alone presumptively deprives the defendant of due process\u201d. This Court finds that the publication of the articles did not constitute \u201cinherently prejudicial publicity which has so saturated the community, as to have a probable impact upon the prospective jurors\u201d. <em>McWilliams v. United States, </em>394 F.2d 41, 44 (1968).</p>\n    <p id=\"b592-6\">Finding the first test inapplicable to this case, the Court has applied the second test. Under this test, the Court examines the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n    <p id=\"b592-7\">Whether there has been prejudicial publicity requiring action by the Court is to be determined by an evaluation of the totality of the surrounding facts in the matter. <em>Wansley v. Slayton, </em>487 F.2d 90, 92 (1973).</p>\n    <p id=\"b592-8\">To grant the change of venue, it must be shown that there is actual jury prejudice.</p>\n    <p id=\"b592-9\">The mere general showing of publicity thought to be adverse to a party is not sufficient to require a change of venue except in the most extraordinary cases. In the usual situation, the movant must at least make a showing that the allegedly prejudicial material reached the venireman, so that a foundation is laid for the possibility of actual bias. (Cites omitted.) It is not sufficient to allege adverse publicity without a showing that the jurors were biased thereby. <em>Ignacio v. People of the Territory of Guam, </em>413 F.2d 513, 518 (1969).</p>\n    <p id=\"b593-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Actual jury prejudice cannot be proven by evidence of mere exposure to articles concerning the defendant or the alleged criminal act. This was articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 724, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 1642-3 (1961):</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b593-3\">It is not required, however, that the jurors be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved. In these days of swift, widespread and diverse methods of communication, an important case can be expected to arouse the interest of the public in the vicinity, and scarcely any of those best qualified to serve as jurors will not have formed some impression or opinion as to the merits of the case. This is particularly true in criminal cases. To hold that the mere existence of any preconceived notion as to the guilt or innocence of an accused, without more, is sufficient to rebut the presumption of a prospective juror\u2019s impartiality would be to establish an impossible standard. It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court. (Cites omitted.)</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b593-4\">The logic of this was noted in <em>Calley v. Callaway, </em>519 F.2d 184, 210, cert. den. 425 U.S. 911, 96 S.Ct. 1505 (1976):</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b593-5\">If in this age of instant, mass communication, we were to automatically disqualify persons who have heard about an alleged crime from serving as. a juror, the inevitable result would be that truly heinous or notorious acts will go unpunished. The law does not prohibit the informed citizen from participating in the affairs of justice.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b593-6\">The proper procedure for ascertaining whether the adverse publicity has actually biased the prospective jurors is voir dire. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>542 F.2d 186 (1976); <em>Wansley v. Slayton, </em>487 F.2d 92 (1973); <em>Margoles v. United States, </em>407 F.2d 727, cert. den. 396 U.S. 833, 90 S.Ct. 89. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>People of the Territory of Guam v. Mendiola, </em>No. 73-2680 (9th Cir. Ct. of Appeals, filed May 17, 1974), dealing specifically with a Sixth Amendment challenge to a denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>of change of venue on Guam, held that the trial court properly approached the situation as one to be handled upon voir dire.</p>\n    <p id=\"b594-5\">Jury selection is set for August 10, 1978. Thus, the defendant has brought his motion for change of venue before the Court has had the opportunity to voir dire the jury and determine whether the defendant can receive a fair and impartial trial. Defendant\u2019s motion is premature.</p>\n    <p id=\"b594-6\">For the reasons aforementioned, defendant\u2019s motion is denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b594-7\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Aguon\u2019s motion for summary judgment filed August 30, 1978, and argued September 29, 1978.</p>\n    <p id=\"b621-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Plaintiff Turtle Cove, Incorporated, subleased from Integrated Development Corporation (IDC), a parcel of property for purposes of development as a tourist attraction. Defendant Estate of Aguon had leased the property to IDC. After execution of the sublease, a suit was filed in District Court seeking to void the deed conveying the instant property from Josefina A. Roberto to the lessor, Estate of Aguon. That litigation, District Court Civil Case No. 154-72, resulted in judgment in favor of Aguon.</p>\n    <p id=\"b621-3\">During the duration of Case No. 154-72 lis pendens was filed against the leased property. Plaintiff alleges that this resulted in the cessation of development and sizeable monetary damages. They further allege that the Aguon\u2019s failure to notify Turtle Cove of the Roberto claim coupled with the filing of 154-72 constituted a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment contained in paragraph 4 of the prime lease.</p>\n    <p id=\"b621-4\">As a separate cause of action they allege that defendant Aguon is liable for typhoon damage to the property on the theory that Aguon impliedly covenanted to require IDC to obtain insurance on the premises. Paragraph 11 of the prime lease required the tenant to carry full insurance coverage on the premises.</p>\n    <p id=\"b621-5\">The covenant of quiet enjoyment insures that the tenant shall hold the premises free from eviction by a person holding paramount title or by the lessor or those claiming title under him. <em>Carty v. Blauth, </em>169 Cal. 713, 147 P. 949 <em>(1915); Lost Key Mines, Inc. v. Hamilton, </em>109 Cal.App.2d 569, 241 P.2d 273 (1952). That covenant generally affords no protection against interferences with the covenantee\u2019s possession made by wrongdoing third persons, or by holders of inferior titles, whom the covenantee could defeat. 6 Powell on Real Property, Paragraph 608. When the eviction is due to the acts of trespassers or persons with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>inferior title the remedy is against the person by whom the acts are committed, not the grantor, <em>Platner v. Vincent, </em>187 Cal. 443, 202 P. 655 (1921).</p>\n    <p id=\"b622-5\">In the instant action, the claim of the Robertos was adjudged to be without merit. The title of Aguon was, in fact, good title as covenanted. Plaintiff apparently relies on an alleged failure by Aguon to inform Turtle Cove of a possible title dispute as a breach. Such a failure, prior to execution of the lease, does not constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Plaintiff has failed to bring to this Court\u2019s attention any case finding a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment by virtue of the filing of an unsuccessful quiet title action. Perhaps for this reason they rely on an alleged omission prior to the execution of the lease as breach of the covenant. Again, no authority for such a proposition has been presented.</p>\n    <p id=\"b622-6\">Since defendant has not answered in this action, the Court will assume the allegation of the complaint to be true for purposes of this motion. Therefore, there are no factual issues remaining. There has been no breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and defendant is entitled to summary judgment as to the first cause of action.</p>\n    <p id=\"b622-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s second cause of action alleges that defendant Estate of Aguon breached an implied covenant to require IDC to insure the premises. It is black letter law that a sublessee can have no greater rights against the lessor under the lease than the original lessee had. <em>Handleman v. Pickerill, </em>84 Cal.App. 214, 257 P. 890 (1927); see generally 30 Cal.Jur.2d, Landlord and Tenant, Section 245; 49 Am.Jur.2d, Landlord and Tenant, Section 508. IDC could not have sued defendant Estate of Aguon for IDC\u2019s own failure to insure. Therefore, Turtle Cove, IDC\u2019s sub-lessee, cannot sue the estate for that same failure.</p>\n    <p id=\"b623-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>For the foregoing reasons defendant Estate of Aguon\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to the first and second causes of action is granted.</p>\n    <p id=\"b623-3\">SUBMIT ORDER.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Section 9990.8(b) permits the \u201cplaintiff\u201d to \u201cappeal the panel\u2019s findings in the Superior Court of Guam.\u201d The other party has no corresponding right under the act to appeal an adverse decision of the panel on the issue of liability. <em>Wright v. Central Dupage Hospital Association </em>(S.Ct. Ill. 1976), 347 N.E.2d 736.</p>\n    <p id=\"b358-4\">The word \u201cappeal\u201d in this connection means a trial <em>de novo. In re Appropriation for Highway Purposes, </em>148 N.E.2d 242, 245, 246, 104 Ohio App. 243. This interpretation is most favorable to the Defendants\u2019 position.</p>\n    <p id=\"b358-5\">2. The Act provides that only certain review is available after the panel makes an award. It can be confirmed, corrected, or vacated. (Section 9990.10(c)). There is no provision for trial by jury. <em>Smyth Sales v. Petroleum Heat &amp; Power Co., </em>141 F.2d 41 (3rd Cir. 1944); <em>Wright v. Central Dupage Hospital Association, </em>supra.</p>\n    <p id=\"b358-6\">The confirmed award, in fact, becomes a judgment. (Section 9990.10 (o)). Should a dissatisfied party commence a civil action, his opponent would undoubtedly assert res judicata as an affirmative defense.</p>\n    <p id=\"b358-7\">The language of Section 9990.13 (a) does not preserve the right to trial by jury. The expressed intent runs counter to the provisions of the Act. No authority is granted to anyone by the Act to establish procedures by which the right may be exercised.</p>\n    <p id=\"b358-8\">3. The act is fatal for the failure to provide for jury trial in the two instances cited above.

Supreme Court of Guam, Dillingham Corporation of the Pacific, Real Party in Interest, </em>Civil Case No. 74-177 (hereinafter cited as <em>Agana Bay), </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>District Court of Guam apparently rendered, at least temporarily, the Supreme Court of Guam a nullity. The term apparently is necessitated inasmuch as the doctrine of dicta would seem to have some bearing on this, or for that matter, any court\u2019s interpretation of that decision. That doctrine requires for the rule of stare decisis to apply that a decision be limited to the precise issue before it. <em>People v. Gregg, </em>85 Cal. Rptr. 273, 5 C.A.3d 502 (1970). It is this Court\u2019s opinion that the precise issue before the District Court in <em>Agcma Bay </em>was whether the Supreme Court of Guam was legally constituted to act on appellate matters brought before it. It is therefore not certain that this narrow a reading of that decision would result in the conclusion that the Supreme Court of Guam is an entity without the power to act on matters certified to it from the Superior Court of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b301-3\">The decision in <em>Agana Bay </em>is presently before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and a decision is anticipated imminently, which should be most dispositive of the status of the Supreme Court of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b301-4\">A refusal to certify to the Supreme Court during this unusual and hopefully temporary hiatus, would irretrievably prevent the Supreme Court from ever hearing this matter. A court which the Guam Legislature made most unequivocally clear it wished to be the forum in which this dispute was resolved.</p>\n    <p id=\"b301-5\">For the above reasons, this Court hereby affirms its order of May 20, 1975, to certify the above entitled action to the Supreme Court of Guam.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Lee <em>&amp; </em>Co. (Guam) Ltd.\u2019s motion to quash service of summons. Defendant\u2019s motion is based on the contention that Danny Tsung was not a proper person under Guam Rules of Civil Procedure \u00a7 4(d)(3) to be served with process on behalf of the corporation.</p>\n    <p id=\"b586-14\">The affidavit of Tsung submitted in support of the motion stated that he was not \u201cthe President or other head of the James S. Lee &amp; Co. (Guam), a Guam domestic corporation, nor a vice-president, a secretary, an assistant secre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>tary, general manager or a person designated for service of process or authorized to receive service of process on behalf of said corporation.\u201d The affidavit of Jack A. Rosenzweig states that the president of defendant corporation told him to conduct business with Tsung when the president was unavailable, that Tsung signed checks relating to the transaction at issue on behalf of defendant and that Tsung has executed amended mortgages as a representative of defendant. Furthermore, the affidavit of Robert A. Haut states that Tsung has appeared before the Superior Court pursuant to examination of judgment debtor proceedings to answer concerning defendant\u2019s property.</p>\n    <p id=\"b587-3\">The actual title of Tsung is not dispositive of the issue here. Service has been upheld upon a sales manager <em>(Lane Ltd. v. Larus &amp; Bro. Co., </em>140 F.Supp. 466 (1956)), a fiscal agent <em>(Jacobwitz v. Thomson, </em>141 F.2d 72 (1944)), a factory representative <em>(Farr Co. v. Gratiot, </em>92 F.Supp. 320 (1950)), and a technical representative <em>(Stockwell v. Page Aircraft Maintenance, Inc., </em>212 F.Supp. 102 (1962)).</p>\n    <p id=\"b587-4\">In determining who may be validly served under Rule 4(d)(3), the following quotation has been cited on numerous occasions with approval:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b587-5\">The rationale of all rules for service of process on corporations is that service must be made on a representative so integrated with the corporation sued as to make it a priori supposable that he will realize his responsibilities and know what he should do with any legal papers served on him. <em>Goetz v. Interlake S.S. Co., </em>47 F.2d 753, 757 (1931).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b587-6\">In the instant action, it is clear from the affidavits that Tsung exercised substantial authority and control over the operations of defendant corporation. Although Tsung was not expressly appointed to receive process, the Court is of the opinion that for the purposes of the service of process herein, he was an authorized agent. See, e.g., <em>Cohen v. Physical Culture Shoe Co., etc., 28 </em>F.Supp. 679 (1938).</p>\n    <p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Defendant\u2019s motion to quash service of summons is denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b588-5\">Defendant shall have twenty (20) days from the date of this order in which to answer.</p>\n    <p id=\"b588-6\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Section 70.25(b), (c) in pertinent part provides for discovery by the prosecution of reports and statements by experts made in connection with the case which are to be used at trial, the nature of the defenses to be used at trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>and the names and addresses of the witnesses to be called at trial in support of the defenses.</p>\n    <p id=\"b576-5\">It is defendant\u2019s position that discovery under this statute violates his constitutional rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Beyond the mere assertion that the discovery violates his Sixth Amendment rights, defendant has failed to present any argument indicating in what way his Sixth Amendment rights have been impaired. Therefore, the Court finds no Sixth Amendment violation.</p>\n    <p id=\"b576-6\">Nor does the Court find the statute at issue violates defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n    <p id=\"b576-7\">The United States Supreme Court has upheld prosecutorial pre-trial discovery against a Fifth Amendment challenge. The Court in <em>Williams v. Florida, </em>399 U.S. 78, 90 S.Ct. 1893 (1970), found constitutional a Florida discovery statute requiring the defendant to notify the prosecution of his intention to use an alibi defense and of the names of the witnesses he intends to call.</p>\n    <p id=\"b576-8\">Although that case was addressing the narrower issue of notice-of-alibi, dicta indicates that the Court would uphold a more extensive discovery statute such as \u00a7 70.25(b), (c).</p>\n    <p id=\"b576-9\">The adversary system of trial is hardly an end in itself; it is not yet a poker game in which players enjoy an absolute right always to conceal their cards until played. <em>Williams v. Florida, </em>90 S.Ct. at 1896.</p>\n    <p id=\"b576-10\">The dissenters in <em>Williams </em>reinforce this Court\u2019s opinion that the Supreme Court laid the groundwork for broader pre-trial discovery.</p>\n    <p id=\"b576-11\">Although this case itself involves only a notice-of-alibi provision, it is clear that the decision means that a State can require a defendant to disclose in advance of trial any and all information he might possibly use to defend himself at trial. <em>Williams v. Florida, </em>90 S.Ct. at 1909.</p>\n    <p id=\"b577-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>The Supreme Court\u2019s dicta in <em>Dennis v. United States, </em>384 U.S. 855, 86 S.Ct. 1840 (1966), is also illustrious of the Court\u2019s seeming willingness to uphold broader discovery.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b577-3\">. . . the growing realization that disclosure, rather than suppression, of relevant materials ordinarily promotes the proper administration of criminal justice.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b577-4\">The expanding body of materials, judicial and otherwise, favoring disclosure in criminal cases analogous to the civil practice. <em>Dennis v. United States, </em>86 S.Ct. at 1849.</p>\n    <p id=\"b577-5\">The Court notes that defendant has cited <em>United States v. Fratello, </em>44 F.R.D. 444 (S.D.N.Y. 1968), and <em>Cantillon v. Superior Court, </em>305 F.Supp 304 (C.D. Cal. 1969), in support of his allegation of a Fifth Amendment violation. These cases are <em>pre-Williams </em>and, therefore, do not reflect present Supreme Court thinking on pre-trial discovery.</p>\n    <p id=\"b577-6\">It should be emphasized that not all evidence obtained from a defendant is privileged under the Fifth Amendment. Among other things, the accused have been subject to: Blood samples and tests, <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826 <em>(1966); </em>appearing in lineups, <em>United States v. Wade, </em>385 U.S. 811, 87 S.Ct. 81 (1966); posing in court for identification purposes, <em>People v. Clark, </em>18 Cal.2d 449, 116 P.2d 56 (1941); disclosure of records and documents kept by accused in compliance with state or federal statute, <em>Shapiro v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 1375 (1948).</p>\n    <p id=\"b577-7\">In delineating the protective scope of the Fifth Amendment, the Supreme Court in <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>86 S.Ct. at 1831, reiterated:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b577-8\">History and a long line of authorities in lower courts have consistently limited its protection to situations in which the State seeks to submerge those values by obtaining the evidence against an accused through the cruel, simple expedient of compelling it from his own mouth.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Section 70.25 does not compel the defendant to be a witness against himself from his own mouth. But if he chooses not to remain silent, \u00a7 70.25(b), (c) merely requires him to disclose prior to trial information which he intends to disclose at trial. The reasoning in <em>Williams, </em>referring to the notice-of-alibi statute, is equally applicable to the statute at issue:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b578-5\">At most, the rule only compelled petitioner to accelerate the timing of his disclosures, forcing him to divulge at an earlier date information that the petitioner from the beginning planned to divulge at trial. Nothing in the Fifth Amendment privilege entitles a defendant as a matter of constitutional right to await the end of the State\u2019s case before announcing the nature of his defense, any more than it entitles to await the jury\u2019s verdict on the State\u2019s case-in-chief before deciding whether or not to take the stand himself. <em>Williams v. Florida, </em>90 S.Ct. at 1898.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b578-6\">The Fifth Amendment does not grant to the accused a right not to have his defenses investigated. \u201c. . . for the Constitution does not protect a defendant from the consequences of a defense he makes, nor does it assure him a right to so defend as to deny the state a chance to check into the truth of his position.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Sikora v. District Ct., </em>462 P.2d 897 at 899.</p>\n    <p id=\"b578-7\">Section 75.25(b), (c) provides the prosecution with the procedural mechanism with which it can investigate facts crucial to the determination of the case. Prosecutorial discovery assists in the ascertainment of truth and justice. In <em>Williams, </em>Chief Justice Burger in his concurring opinion enunciated the advantage of allowing prosecutorial pre-trial discovery:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b578-8\">In either case the ends of justice will have been served and the processes expedited. These are the likely consequences of an enlarged and truly reciprocal pre-trial disclosure of evidence and the move away from the \u201csporting contest\u201d idea of criminal justice. <em>Williams v. Florida, </em>90 S.Ct. at 1909.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b579-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>In <em>Wardius v. Oregon, </em>412 U.S. 470, 93 S.Ct. 2208 (1973), the Supreme Court again noted:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b579-3\">The growth of such discovery devices is a salutory development which, by increasing the evidence available to both parties enhances the fairness of the adversary system. As we recognized in <em>Williams, </em>nothing in the Due Process Clause precludes States from experimenting with systems of broad discovery designed to achieve these goals. <em>Wardius v. Oregon, </em>93 S.Ct. at 2211.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b579-4\">Reflecting the need for discovery, a number of jurisdictions have enacted or judicially created prosecutorial pretrial discovery provisions which are broader than notice-of-alibi. A sampling of these States include: New York, see <em>People v. Damon, </em>247 N.E.2d 651, 299 N.Y.S.2d 830, 24 N.Y.2d 256 (1969); New Jersey, see <em>State v. Montague, </em>262 A.2d 398, 55 N.J. 387 (1970); Missouri, see <em>State v. Burton, </em>455 S.W.2d 60 (1976); Oregon, see <em>State v. Wolf, </em>536 P.2d 555 (1975); Montana, see <em>State ex rel. Sikora v. District Ct., </em>462 P.2d 897 (1969); Illinois, see <em>People ex rel. Carey v. Strayhorn, </em>6 Ill.2d 85, 329 N.E.2d 194 (1975).</p>\n    <p id=\"b579-5\">The California Legislature has not enacted pre-trial discovery statutes in criminal proceedings. It is the position of the California Supreme Court in <em>Reynolds v. Superior Court, </em>117 Cal. Rptr. 437, 528 P.2d 45 (1974), that it does not want to both promulgate the statutes and pass on their constitutionality, or by promulgating the statutes infringe on the Legislature\u2019s powers. Defendant cites four pre-<em>Reynolds </em>California cases: <em>McMullen v. Superior Court, </em>6 Cal.App.3d 224, 85 Cal. Rptr. 729 (1970); <em>Prudhomme v. Superior Court, </em>85 Cal. Rptr. 129 (1970); <em>People v. Bais, </em>31 Cal.App.3d 663, 107 Cal. Rptr. 519 (1973); <em>People v. Chavez, </em>33 Cal.App.3d 454, 109 Cal. Rptr. 157. Defendant\u2019s reliance on these cases is misplaced. Until the California Legislature enacts criminal pre-trial discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>statutes and their constitutionality is challenged, California\u2019s position on their constitutionality is left unanswered.</p>\n    <p id=\"b580-5\">Guam, unlike California, has enacted criminal discovery statutes. For the reasons aforementioned the Court finds no violation of defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n    <p id=\"b580-6\">Defendant further contends that, in any event, discovery should not be granted absent a showing of materiality and reasonableness. In support of his contention defendant cites <em>United States v. Estremara, </em>531 F.2d 1103 (2d Cir. 1976). The quotation cited refers to the application of Rule 16 of the Federal Code of Criminal Procedure. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure are not applicable to Guam in territorial matters such as this.</p>\n    <p id=\"b580-7\">Additionally, defendant argues that discovery should not be granted absent particularized requests. As authority, he cites the California case of <em>McMullen v. Superior Court, </em>6 Cal.App.3d 224, 85 Cal. Rptr. 729 (1970) which was obviated by the California Supreme Court in <em>Reynolds v. Superior Court, </em>supra.</p>\n    <p id=\"b580-8\">Government of Guam\u2019s motion for an order compelling discovery under \u00a7 70.25(b), (c) is granted.</p>\n    <p id=\"b580-9\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Immediately after the plaintiff presented his case, the trial judge dismissed the action for failing to present a prima facie case and the jury was excused. Appellant argues that the trial court erred in dismissing his suit for two reasons:</p>\n    <p id=\"b489-4\">1. That evidence as to certain traffic citations was improperly excluded ;</p>\n    <p id=\"b489-5\">2. That a recess should have been granted so that an unsubpoenaed witness might be located.</p>\n    <p id=\"b489-6\">The appellate court finds that there is nothing in the record to suggest that the trial court abused its discretion or committed error; therefore, the dismissal of appellant\u2019s case must be affirmed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b489-7\">Plaintiff tried unsuccessfully to introduce as evidence a photocopy of an accident report to show \u201cthat the driver of the tractor-trailer at the time of the accident was given a traffic citation\u201d. (Appellant\u2019s Brief, page 3.) However, such a report was clearly hearsay, and while an exception to the rule might have been available, the plaintiff failed to lay any foundation as to the report\u2019s trustworthiness or accuracy. See 29 Am.Jur.2d \u00a7 849. Also, as cited to by the appellees, a number of California cases have held that police reports do not fall under the official or business records exception to the hearsay rule. Cf. <em>MacLean v. City and County of San Francisco, </em>151 C.A.2d 133, 143, 311 P.2d 158, 164 (1957); <em>Hoel v. City of Los Angeles, </em>136 C.A.2d 295, 309, 288 P.2d 989, 997 (1955).</p>\n    <p id=\"b489-8\">Furthermore, it must be pointed out that plaintiff apparently was seeking to base his entire case on this accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>report. He states, on page 3 of his brief, that \u201c[t]his exhibit would have brought this cause of action clearly within the doctrine of Kes Ipsa Loquitar. See 65A Corpus Juris Secundum Section 220.2.\u201d The court doubts whether res ipsa loquitar would apply under facts such as these, but more significantly, it would be stretching an exception to the hearsay rule to its breaking point to allow a party to base his entire case on a traffic report for which no foundation was laid and which was prepared by a policeman who was not subject to cross-examination by the parties.</p>\n    <p id=\"b490-5\">Since the report was properly excluded on a hearsay objection there is no reason for the court to consider whether it might have been admitted under any exception to the best evidence rule. (Although the court notes that plaintiff failed to make any offer of proof that the original accident report was unavailable. See \u00a7 1855 of the Guam Code of Civil Procedure.)</p>\n    <p id=\"b490-6\">Appellant states without citation that it was error for the trial judge to refuse a short recess so that an unsubpoenaed witness could be found. While the trial court might have waited several minutes for Mr. Arnold to appear, the plaintiff made no offer of proof as to what testimony the court could expect from this errant witness and plaintiff seemed immediately to have abandoned his desire to call Mr. Arnold. (Transcript, pages 33:23 to 35:9.) Since the plaintiff failed to subpoena Mr. Arnold there was no abuse of discretion in refusing a continuance. <em>Somers Estate, </em>82 C.A.2d 757, 187 P.2d 433, 435 (1947); <em>Kalmus v. Kalmus, </em>130 C.A.2d 405, 230 P.2d 57 (1951).</p>\n    <p id=\"b490-7\">Appellant also asks the court to consider a peripheral issue where sanctions were assessed against \u201cplaintiff, James M. Lester and/or his attorney, John M. Webster [to] pay $100.00 each as reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to [both defendants] for costs in bringing on this motion to compel discovery\u201d. (From an Order filed in Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>on February 6,1976.) It seems that while the plaintiff was willing to make certain business and tax records available to the defense for photocopying, he refused to allow similar photocopying of his income tax returns, instead offering defendants the opportunity to copy and take notes from the returns.</p>\n    <p id=\"b491-3\">Rule 34 of the Superior Court\u2019s Rules of Civil Procedure provides that \u201c[a]ny party may serve on any other party a request ... to inspect and copy any designated documents [relevant under Rule 26(b)] . . . .\u201d First, a statute is to be given its plain and ordinary meaning, and if Rule 34 were drafted to equate the word \u201ccopy\u201d with \u201cphotocopy\u201d it should have so provided. Furthermore, the court believes that handcopying should have been sufficient here for defendants\u2019 purposes, especially since they have not contended that it would have been unduly burdensome to have done this copying by hand (where presumably only certain relevant information as to gross income would have been desired). Finally, even if photocopying were called for under the statute and these facts, there is a question whether or not the plaintiff\u2019s earnings were properly in issue and relevant to the suit at hand. According to the insurance company\u2019s Appellee brief, at page 9, \u201c[t]he plaintiff, in his complaint, prayed for relief from permanent partial disability and thereby raised the issue of his loss of earning capacity\u201d. However, at trial, counsel for the insurance company objected to any testimony whether plaintiff\u2019s alleged injuries had affected his line of work on the ground that it was irrelevant because no special damages had been pleaded as to loss of income. (Transcript, pages 17:15 to 19.) The court is at a loss to understand how counsel for the appellee can contend that the complaint \u201craised the issue of [plaintiff\u2019s] loss of earning capacity\u201d, while at the same time they successfully argued at trial that in failing to plead special damages any evidence as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s earning abilities became irrelevant. From the above, it is evident that cost sanctions were erroneously obtained against the plaintiff where he at least substantially complied with the requirements of Rule 34 with regard to copying of documents, and where counsel for appellee at trial effectively argued that evidence as to his employment capability was not relevant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b492-5\">Admittedly counsel for plaintiff had a difficult task in proving a case where two witnesses had died and where the police officer reporting the accident and the treating physician were off-island. (Transcript, page 36:15.) However, the trial judge had no choice other than to dismiss when plaintiff had offered absolutely nothing to connect the defendants with his alleged injuries. The only testimony presented at trial was that of the plaintiff who testified in effect that he was walking down the road at around 3:30 to pick up some Christmas cards and suddenly six hours later he found himself in the hospital. (Transcript, pages 11:24 to 12:9.) Even if this testimony had been augmented by the police accident report (assuming a proper foundation), the defendants would have been severely prejudiced in losing their right to cross-examine the only real witness against them (the investigative officer). Presumably the police officer was called to the scene of the accident and his report was therefore based on impressions of other eyewitnesses unknown to the court and the defendants. Clearly, the trial court did not err in excluding such an unreliable piece of evidence, especially since the plaintiff did nothing to establish its trustworthiness. Plaintiff also did not establish an offer of proof as to why Mr. Arnold\u2019s testimony was crucial to his case, and the trial court was correct in refusing to allow a recess.</p>\n    <p id=\"b492-6\">The dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s suit is affirmed on appeal, while the awarding of cost sanctions for discovery must be reversed for the reasons set forth above. Therefore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>sum of $100.00 is to be subtracted from total costs entered in favor of J. L. Baker and Sons for $292.85 and $100.00 is to be subtracted from total costs entered in favor of the Insurance Company of North America for $435.10 (with the total costs against the plaintiff, as guaranteed by the surety, in favor of both defendants now totalling $527.95).</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

This, of course, does not necessarily mean that the ruling itself was in error.</p>\n  </footnote>\n  <opinion type=\"majority\">\n    <author id=\"b505-4\">THOMPSON, <em>District Judge</em></author>\n    <p id=\"b505-5\">OPINION</p>\n    <p id=\"b505-6\">The defendant was convicted on December 18, 1975, of unauthorized, unlawful delivery of a controlled substance (heroin). He now appeals his conviction on two grounds: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction, and (2) a subsequent criminal act was improperly allowed into evidence. Before turning to these two legal issues, a short rendition of the facts underlying the conviction is necessary.</p>\n    <p id=\"b505-7\">On May 28, 1975, at approximately 1:05 a.m., an undercover narcotics agent, Nelsa Ramsey, accompanied by an informant named Morris Denton, purchased a one hundred dollar \u201cplate\u201d of heroin from a man she identified as Junior Santos at trial. The heroin transaction took place at the Carbullido house in Barrigada which was the residence of the defendant\u2019s brother, Roque Santos. Sergeant Francisco Sanchez, Ramsey\u2019s supervising officer, observed the transaction as he passed by surveilling the scene from an automobile.</p>\n    <p id=\"b505-8\">Junior Santos\u2019 sole defense was misidentification. He put on evidence, but did not testify himself, that on May 28, 1975, at 1:05 a.m. he was not residing or present at the Carbullido house, but was instead asleep with his wife at the home of his father-in-law. The defendant did not contest any other elements of the offense.</p>\n    <p id=\"b505-9\">The People were allowed to present evidence that, approximately six months subsequent to his arrest in this case, the defendant was dealing in heroin. Over defense counsel\u2019s strenuous objection, Policrano Madarang, a former heroin pusher, testified that on November 20, 1975, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Junior Santos provided him with twenty \u201cdime bags\u201d of heroin to sell. Their arrangement called for Madarang to pay Santos for the fronted heroin once it had been sold.</p>\n    <p id=\"b506-5\">The defendant\u2019s first appellate contention is that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to support the conviction. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party as required by precedent too numerous to cite, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to warrant a conviction. Two police officers, one a participant-purchaser and the other an eyewitness to the transaction, identified the defendant as the seller of the heroin. The sinister inferences drawn by the defendant from witnesses or evidence not presented by the People do little, if anything, to rebut such direct, highly incriminatory testimony. The evidence which was presented cannot be negated on appeal by speculation concerning evidence not presented.</p>\n    <p id=\"b506-6\">Defendant\u2019s second contention on appeal is that the trial court erred in admitting the evidence of his subsequent heroin dealings with Policrano Madarang. Evidence of other criminal acts by a defendant is not admissible to show a defendant\u2019s general propensity to commit criminal acts, but are admissible if relevant to a disputed, material issue in the case. Federal Rule of Evidence \u00a7 404(b); California Evidence Code \u00a7 1101(b); Witkin\u2019s California Evidence \u00a7 341(2) (aa) (2nd ed. 1966). However, due to the inevitable prejudice suffered by a defendant when evidence of other criminal acts is admitted\u2014</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b506-7\">. . . the relevancy of evidence of other crimes, and therefore its admissibility, must be examined with care. The evidence should be received with \u201cextreme caution,\u201d and if its connection with the crime charged is not clearly perceived, the doubt should be resolved in favor of the accused.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b507-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number><em>People v. Guerrero, </em>16 C.3d 719, 724, 129 Cal. Rptr. 166, 548 P.2d 366 (1976), quoting People <em>v. Kelly, </em>66 C.2d 232, 239, 57 Cal. Rptr. 363, 424 P.2d 947 (1967).</p>\n    <p id=\"b507-3\">In this case the only material issue in dispute was the identification of the defendant as the person who sold heroin to Agent Ramsey at the Carbullido house on May 28, 1975. The defendant did not contest that whoever sold the heroin did so knowingly, intentionally, and without mistake;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his sole defense was that he did not do it. Another criminal act is relevant to the issue of identity only if it is sufficiently similar to the crime charged to warrant an inference that the same person committed both:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b507-4\">When, as here, a primary issue of fact is whether the defendant\u2014 rather than some other person \u2014 committed the charged offense, evidence of uncharged offenses is ordinarily admissible if it discloses a distinctive modus operandi common both to the charged and uncharged offenses. [Citations omitted.] A modus operandi gives rise to a reasonable inference that the charged and uncharged offenses were committed by the same person when the marks common to those offenses set them apart from other offenses of the same general variety. [Citations omitted.] \u201cIf the inference is weak, the probative value is likewise weak, and the court\u2019s discretion should be exercised in favor of exclusion.\u201d <em>(People v. Haston, </em>69 Cal.2d 233, 247 (1968)).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b507-5\"><em>People v. Matson, </em>13 C.3d 35, 40, 117 Cal. Rptr. 664, 528 P.2d 752 (1974). Here, the inference is weak and the evidence should have been excluded.</p>\n    <p id=\"b507-6\">The only \u201cmark\u201d common to both the defendant\u2019s hand-to-hand sale of a hundred dollar \u201cplate\u201d of heroin on May 28th and his recruitment of Madarang six months later as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>a pusher is that both transactions involved heroin \u2014 hardly a distinctive, identifying feature. In fact, the November 20th recruitment of Madarang evidenced a distinct change, rather than an identifying continuation, in Santos\u2019 modus operandi. Thus, there is absolutely no basis on which to premise an inference that the person who recruited Madarang in November was the same person who sold the heroin to Agent Ramsey. Therefore, the evidence of the defendant\u2019s subsequent criminal activity should have been excluded as having no relevance to the only disputed issue, the identity of the seller. <em>United States v. Coades, </em>549 F.2d 1303 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>People v. Guerrero, </em>supra at 725; <em>People v. Law, </em>40 C.A.3d 69, 87-89, 114 Cal. Rptr. 708 (5th Dist. 1974).</p>\n    <p id=\"b508-5\">Having concluded that the trial court erred in admitting the evidence of defendant\u2019s subsequent criminal activity, the question remains whether the error was so prejudicial as to require a new trial. If the evidence of a defendant\u2019s guilt is overwhelming, an error in admitting evidence of other criminal activity does not require reversal of the conviction. <em>United States v. Coades, </em>supra. This, however, is not a case in which the defendant\u2019s guilt is obvious. We did find infra that there was sufficient evidence to support the defendant\u2019s conviction, but the evidence, though sufficient, was far from overwhelming. In fact, our thorough reading of the transcript indicates to us that the case was quite close; the defendant\u2019s at times effective cross-examination of Government witnesses and the testimony of his own witnesses make it impossible to say with certainty that even had the evidence of his subsequent criminal activity not been erroneously admitted, he would have been convicted anyway.</p>\n    <p id=\"b508-6\">Borrowing from <em>People v. Guerrero, </em>supra at 730, the net effect of the erroneously admitted evidence on the jury was to paint a sign on the defendant which said \u201cheroin dealer.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>To affirm defendant\u2019s conviction would be to ignore the very real possibility that the jury convicted him on the basis of this label rather than on the strength of the evidence presented by the People directly relating to the May 28th transaction. The defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n    <p id=\"b509-3\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The appellant was justified in committing the offense charged.</p>\n    <p id=\"b118-21\">2. The appellant committed the offense through misfortune or by accident.</p>\n    <p id=\"b119-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>3. The evidence is insufficient to warrant a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt and the judgment is the result of passion and prejudice.</p>\n    <p id=\"b119-3\">4. The sentence is excessive.</p>\n    <p id=\"b119-4\">In our opinion, however, these points all boil down to the point that, from the appellant\u2019s point of view, the trial judge believed the wrong witness and was unduly influenced by the fact, brought out in cross-examination of the accused, that he had been convicted in the District Court of Guam of the felony of Assault and Battery with a Deadly Weapon a little over four and one-half years before the incident involved in the present one. There is not a shred of evidence in the record, beyond the finding and sentence to which the appellant objects, to show any passion or prejudice on the part of the trial judge, and we find no legitimate basis for any claim that there was such passion or prejudice.</p>\n    <p id=\"b119-5\">There was a sharp conflict in the testimony. The only eyewitnesses to the event who testified were the victim and the accused. The only other witnesses were the Department of Public Safety Sergeant to whom the accused reported the incident, and the Department of Public Safety Patrolman who investigated it very shortly after it happened and took the victim to the hospital. It was stipulated at the trial that the victim was intoxicated at the time he reached the hospital and, further, that he had lacerations on his right ear, neck, and shoulder. The victim testified that these lacerations were the result of an unprovoked attack on him by the accused with a bolo knife. The accused admitted he had injured the victim with the bolo knife, but claimed that he had not intended to do this and was merely defending himself against an alleged, threatened attack by the victim with a stick about four feet long and around two inches by two inches thick. Obviously, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>the trial judge had believed the accused, he should not have found him guilty, but it is equally clear from the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law that he didn\u2019t believe the accused and did believe the victim.</p>\n    <p id=\"b120-5\">As stated in 3 Am. Jur., Appeal and Error, Section 901:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b120-6\">\u201cIt is a well-established principle that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact upon conflicting evidence are binding on appeal and will not be disturbed by the appellate court where they are reasonably supported or sustained by some substantial, credible, and competent evidence, and where no error prejudicial to the appellant occurred in the ruling on the admission of evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b120-7\">See also:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b120-8\"><em>Symons v. United States </em>(9th Cir., 1949), 178 F.2d 615, in which the court stated at page 620: \u2014 \u201cIt is the duty of the trial court and not this court to weigh such conflicts in the testimony and to determine the credibility and truthfulness of the witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b120-9\"><em>United States v. Bazzell </em>(7th Cir., 1951), 187 F.2d 878, where it is stated by the court at page 881: \u2014 \u201cBazzell\u2019s first contention is that there was no kidnapping under the statute, that is to say, the evidence did not sustain the verdict. As to this contention, it is well to remember that under the long and well-established law we may consider only that evidence favorable to the plaintiff. We are not permitted to weigh conflicting evidence, but must test the sufficiency of the proof upon the basis of what the jury had the right to believe, and not upon what defendant claims the jury should have believed.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b120-10\">We consider that the evidence favorable to the Government which the trial judge had the right to believe, was amply sufficient to support the finding.</p>\n    <p id=\"b120-11\">The appellant also complains of the court\u2019s admission, over the objection of the appellant, of the acknowledgment by the accused in cross-examination that he had been found guilty of a felony of Assault and Battery with a Deadly Weapon in the District Court of Guam allegedly some four years and seven months before the incident involved in this case, although the accused stated he was not sure of the date.</p>\n    <p id=\"b121-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>The general proposition that an accused who takes the witness stand voluntarily to testify in his own behalf thereby waives his immunity from self-incrimination and subjects himself to cross-examination for purposes of impeachment as well as to cross-examination as to the matters about which he was examined in chief, is well-established. 58 Am.Jur., Witnesses, Sections 96 and 687; <em>Raffel v. United States </em>(1926), 271 U.S. 494, 46 S.Ct. 566.</p>\n    <p id=\"b121-3\">According to well-established practice in the Federal Courts in the United States and the great weight of authority in the State Courts, this cross-examination of an accused for purposes of impeaching his credibility may include questioning as to prior conviction of serious crime, where this matter is not controlled by express statute. 58 Am.Jur., Witnesses, Section 749; Weiner v. United States (3rd Cir., 1927), 20 F.2d 522; 6 A.L.R. 1635; 25 A.L.R. 346; 103 A.L.R. 362; 161 A.L.R. 266.</p>\n    <p id=\"b121-4\">It furthermore makes no difference in the application of this rule that the former offense was similar to the one for which the accused is now on trial, so long as no attempt is made to go into ,the details of the former offense. <em>Hall v. United States </em>(D.C. Cir., 1948), 171 F.2d 347; <em>Newman v. United States </em>(5th Cir., 1955), 220 F.2d 289.</p>\n    <p id=\"b121-5\">The question of whether the previous conviction was so remote in time or of such a nature as to be plainly without bearing on the witness\u2019 credibility is a matter resting largely in the discretion of the trial court, but convictions much more remote in time than that involved here have been held to be admissible, and here the prior conviction was of a felony. We find no abuse of discretion in permitting this conviction to be shown by cross-examination of the accused. 58 Am.Jur., Witnesses, Section 746; <em>Burgess v. State </em>(Md., 1931), 155 Atl. 153, 75 A.L.R. 1471.</p>\n    <p id=\"b121-6\">We do not concur in the claim of the Government that the accused here might have been sentenced for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>maximum allowed by the Code for both the Assault and the Battery with which he was charged, since the Assault was necessarily included in the Battery. 4 Am.Jur., Assault and Battery, Section 3, note 18. The sentence imposed by the trial court, however, was within the limits authorized for Battery by Section 243 of the Penal Code of Guam, and was, therefore, within the discretion of the trial court. Only in a very extreme case would we consider interfering with the trial court\u2019s discretion in the matter of sentence. In the present case, in view of the serious nature of the Assault shown by the Government\u2019s witnesses and the accused\u2019s prior record (not limited to the felony conviction discussed above), we see no reason to modify the sentence.</p>\n    <p id=\"b122-5\">The finding and sentence of the Island Court are affirmed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b122-6\">Due to his death, Judge Gilmartin did not take part in this opinion.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Hearing in Criminal Case No. 101F-78 was begun on September 25 and 26, 1978. By stipulation, after the dismissal of that case, the evidence adduced was incorporated into Criminal Case No. 207F-78 heard on October 19,1978.</p>\n    <p id=\"b631-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Evidence was adduced concerning the circumstance attending (1) the removal of physical objects from the Chevrolet Camaro at Naval Regional Medical Center, (2) the taking of defendant\u2019s oral statement by Detective Quenga on May 2, 1978, at Guam Memorial Hospital, and (3) the removal of certain items of clothing from defendant\u2019s hospital room on May 5,1978.</p>\n    <p id=\"b631-3\">The first matter to be considered will be the evidence taken from the yellow Chevrolet Camaro on 1 May 1978.</p>\n    <p id=\"b631-4\">The facts as presented by the Government are that following a shooting occurring at Ling\u2019s Store, the Guam police broadcast a description and license number of a yellow Chevrolet Camaro with several occupants presumed to be in that vicinity. Armed Forces Police Detachment witnesses testified that \u201cresponsibles\u201d were said to be in the described vehicle.</p>\n    <p id=\"b631-5\">A Navy Security Man patroling the hospital grounds saw such a vehicle exceeding the speed limit en route to the emergency room entrance although at that time he was unaware of any of the other facts. He was told upon inquiring that they were involved in a shooting and were being treated.</p>\n    <p id=\"b631-6\">Shortly thereafter, Armed Forces Police Detachment entered the hospital grounds and inquired of security as to the described vehicle. Accompanied by Security, they stopped the exiting car. The car, according to Armed Forces Police Detachment Officer Marker, had bullet holes and flat tires.</p>\n    <p id=\"b631-7\">The driver, a female, initially refused to exit the vehicle but complied when ordered at gunpoint. She was seen to move to the right across the seat before leaving the car.</p>\n    <p id=\"b631-8\">When she left the vehicle the Armed Forces Police Detachment opened her purse which was in the front of the car and found a can of mace and a .357 magnum revolver. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>They then obtained a Commander\u2019s Search Warrant and continued the search of the vehicle.</p>\n    <p id=\"b632-3\">The reasons of necessity, which permit warrantless searches of automobiles and other vehicles upon the combination of probable cause and exigent circumstances, do apply to the case in question.</p>\n    <p id=\"b632-4\">The vehicle fit the description radioed by the police; it had visible bullet holes and flat tires. It was in the vicinity where the vehicle was reported to flee; at least one radio report had characterized the occupants as responsibles. The Security Officer testified he had been previously informed that some of its occupants were being treated for gunshot wounds. All of these factors constitute probable cause to believe it contained evidence of crime.</p>\n    <p id=\"b632-5\">Only one person, not the owner (although the legal title was in question it was clear the sole female removed from the car at this point was not the owner of the vehicle), was within the vehicle. The ability of any of the other prior occupants or owner to return to the car and remove the vehicle or its contents was apparent.</p>\n    <p id=\"b632-6\">The mobility factor therefore still existed and there was a danger arising out of that imminent mobility that evidence could be destroyed or removed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b632-7\">The Commander\u2019s Warrant, obtained after the search commenced, was unnecessary. Under these particular circumstances, the prerogative to make a warrantless search had vested, and once vested did not divert.</p>\n    <p id=\"b632-8\">It is the opinion of this Court that the statement made by defendant at the hospital, while not given in circumstances as egregious as those in <em>Mincy v. Arizona, </em>98 S.Ct. 2408, is, nevertheless, not admissible.</p>\n    <p id=\"b632-9\">The defendant was operated on after being given two (2) anesthetics; he exited the operating room at 9:30 a.m. He had had surgery for 1 <em>y2 </em>hours to repair two bullet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>wounds and was in a cast. His surgeon and attending physician testified that between noon and one o\u2019clock when he (the surgeon) checked the patient he was so drowsy that he could be alerted only by pinching to get a response to pain. The surgeon further testified that it was hospital policy to allow no decision to be made by patients within four hours of the administration of anesthesia or <em>sedative; </em>the reason being, to paraphrase Dr. Tolentino, that the anesthetized or sedated patient could be too compliant to communicate his real thoughts, however superficially coherent he might appear.</p>\n    <p id=\"b633-3\">In light of that persuasive and professional testimony, this Court cannot presume that total mental responsibility had returned to this patient by the time the formal taped questioning began at 1:30 p.m. on 2 May.</p>\n    <p id=\"b633-4\">The quality of the defendant\u2019s mixed Chamarro-English response is not so incisive either in its content or in the tone of the taped conversation to discount the impression left by the doctor\u2019s statement.</p>\n    <p id=\"b633-5\">The situation is exacerbated by the officer\u2019s response to defense counsel that the inaudible portion of defendant\u2019s response (noted on the translated transcript of the tape prepared as an exhibit for the Court) had something to do with defendant\u2019s wanting to talk with someone. The officer testified that he did not pursue defendant\u2019s mumbled comment to clarify what had been said.</p>\n    <p id=\"b633-6\">It is not inconceivable that defendant asked to see a lawyer at this point and the possibility cannot be ignored. Indeed, defendant testified he made such a request.</p>\n    <p id=\"b633-7\">In light of the above, this Court finds that the oral statement was not \u201cthe product of his free and rational choice\u201d, <em>Greenwold v. Wisconsin, </em>390 U.S. 519, 521, 88 S.Ct. 1152, 1154, 20 L.Ed.2d 77, and cannot be used against him at his trial.</p>\n    <p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>From this conclusion as to his condition at the time of the interview, it is apparent that the consent to the release \u25a0of the items of clothing to the police is equally unreliable. If their admissibility were based on defendant\u2019s consent alone, they too would be found lacking.</p>\n    <p id=\"b634-5\">However, it has been stipulated that defendant was \u201cin custody\u201d at the hospital when the clothing was removed. The Government contends that in a sense he was \u201cunder arrest\u201d, the formalities of arrest merely awaiting his discharge. Therefore, the Government maintains, his clothing was available to them to make an inventory of his belongings because such right to inventory exists upon arrest.</p>\n    <p id=\"b634-6\">The Court finds such justification unpersuasive in view of the fact that the formal arrest had <em>not </em>in fact occurred, and the defendant did not know of the status the Government assumed existed. Therefore, the items of clothing are also suppressed for use as evidence against the defendant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b634-7\">This Court therefore denies the motion to suppress the items removed from the Camaro, and grants the motion to suppress the oral statement and the clothing.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Daly\u2019s Motion to Dismiss filed April 17, 1978, and ar~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>gued on May 10, 1978. The motion was based on the argument that Guam\u2019s obscenity statute (Criminal and Correctional Code \u00a7 28.40 et seq.) does not contain a specific definition of prohibited sexual conduct as required by the Supreme Court decision in <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607 (1973).</p>\n    <p id=\"b571-3\">Initially it should be noted that defendant is correct in her assertion that the statute does not list specific sexual conduct. However, the comment makes clear that it was the intent of the Legislature that Guam\u2019s statute comply with standards as set by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b571-4\">The provisions set forth in this article relating to obscenity are believed to conform to standards presently set by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b571-5\">The question then for this court is whether the statute is capable of a construction so as to effectuate the intent of the Legislature. The proper considerations to be utilized in construction of a statute were well stated by the California Supreme Court in the case of <em>In re Haines, </em>195 Cal. 605 at 613, 234 P. 883 at 886 where the court quoted with approval from Lewis Sutherland on Statutory Construction, 2d ed., Section 376:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b571-6\">The mere literal construction of a section in a statute ought not to prevail if it is opposed to the intention of the Legislature apparent by the statute; and if the words are sufficiently flexible to admit of some other construction it is to be adopted. The intent prevails over the letter, and the letter will, if possible, be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b571-7\">The legislative intent was clearly that the obscenity statute conform with Supreme Court standards. An examination of the statute indicates that it does conform with the tripartite definition adopted in Miller,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>mentioned previously, it fails to include specific examples of sexual conduct as required by <em>Miller. </em>The court in <em>Miller </em>gave examples of what would be sufficiently specific conduct.</p>\n    <p id=\"b572-5\">(a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated.</p>\n    <p id=\"b572-6\">(b) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals. 93 S.Ct. at 2615.</p>\n    <p id=\"b572-7\">In a case decided the same day as <em>Miller </em>the court noted that they were prepared to construe terms such as obscene, lewd, etc., in federal statutes as limited to patently offensive \u201chard core\u201d sexual conduct given as examples in <em>Miller. United States v. 12 200 Ft. Reels of Super 8mm Film, </em>413 U.S. 123, 93 S.Ct. 2665 at 2670 (1973).</p>\n    <p id=\"b572-8\">If it can be found that the Legislature\u2019s adoption of the <em>Miller </em>tripartite standard impliedly adopted the examples given in <em>Miller </em>of specific conduct the statute herein involved will survive the constitutional challenge. In the case of <em>Eagle Books, Inc. v. Reinhard, </em>418 F.Supp. 345 (U.S.D.C. Ill. 1976), it was held that a judicial incorporation of the tripartite scheme would not alone satisfy the specificity requirement. However, that case was vacated and remanded in light of <em>Ward v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 767, 97 S.Ct. 2085 (1977), wherein it was held that it was an overly restrictive and unwarranted conclusion that the state court\u2019s adoption of the guidelines did not include the examples as well.</p>\n    <p id=\"b572-9\">Based on the foregoing it is this court\u2019s construction of the instant statute that it includes by implication the examples of specific conduct given in <em>Miller v. California, </em>supra.

One of the Island Court judges supervised the recount and the other heard the case below. We constitute a quorum and our jurisdiction is provided by Section 2620 of the Government Code of Guam. The Guam election law is contained in such Code and our references are to such law unless otherwise indicated. No objections were made below to the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>cedure followed .in instituting the contest and pursuing it. The trial court made extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law and held that certificates of election had properly been issued to the 21 members of the Guam Legislature who received the highest vote. The contestants brought these proceedings upon the assumption that there were so many irregularities involved in the 1962 general election that one or more losing candidates may have been elected.</p>\n    <p id=\"b156-4\">The Guam election law is so comprehensive and detailed that some irregularities are almost inevitable. In some respects the law is contradictory and obscure. While we might wish that the Guam Legislature had enacted legislation better adapted for this community, we must take the law as we find it and hope that a better law will result. We consider the alleged errors in the order in which they were argued in the briefs of counsel, except that we first consider the dismissal of the Election Commissioner as a party defendant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b156-5\">DISMISSAL OF ELECTION COMMISSIONER</p>\n    <p id=\"b156-6\">The Election Commissioner was first joined and then dismissed as a party defendant. The dismissal was proper as he should not have been joined as a party defendant. The only proper parties under Section 2600 are the persons who initiate the contest and the defendants who received the certificate of election. The trial court has ample authority under Section 2615 to find that a candidate other than the defendant has been elected and under Section 2616 to direct the Election Commissioner to issue a certificate of election as directed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b156-7\">ABSENTEE BALLOTS</p>\n    <p id=\"b156-8\">The contestants contend that of 167 absentee ballots actually cast at the election, only 67 had previously been re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>ceived by the Election Commissioner and delivered by him to the precinct officials. We first note that the Election Commissioner did not comply with the appropriate statute. The voter is to be furnished with an envelope in which to place the completed ballot. Section 2461 requires that on the reverse side of the envelope there shall be <em>printed, </em>the blank form of voter\u2019s affidavit. No such envelopes were furnished the voters but mimeographed blank forms were affixed to the reverse side of the envelope by tape or glue. Neither party has raised the question and we point it out simply to indicate the safeguards contained in the election law. The printing is required in order to eliminate the possibility that any voter\u2019s affidavit could be switched from one envelope to another containing a different ballot from that voted.</p>\n    <p id=\"b157-3\">The law concerning absentee ballots, when properly construed, provides different methods for obtaining absentee ballots and voting the same. The voter must expect to be off the island or must expect to be unable to go to the polls if'on the island. He must request an application blank within 120 days prior to the election, and must make application on the required form not more than 60 nor less than 5 days prior to election according to Sections 2452 and 2453. A ballot is either mailed to him or, under Section 2459, within 15 days of the election he may obtain a ballot by applying on the proper form at the office of the Election Commissioner and mark it, swear to it and return it to the Election Commissioner. The Commissioner must deliver all absentee ballots received by him to the precinct board, together with the voter\u2019s application, Section 2467, before the election and he must do this in person. He must report all absentee ballots not received by him for delivery to the precinct officials before the polls close, Section 2469.</p>\n    <p id=\"b157-4\">It appears that on election day disabled voters were allowed to make affidavits for absentee ballots, that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>ballots were marked in the presence of precinct election officials who left the polling places for this purpose, accompanied by a representative or representatives of each of the two political parties taking part in the election, and that such ballots were voted. There is no evidence that any of these were challenged at that time, in accordance with Section 2477. The defendants contend that this procedure is authorized by Section 2464 which authorizes the absentee voter at any time on or before the day of an election to appear before one of the officers mentioned therein and mark his ballot. While admitting that these provisions are inconsistent with other provisions in the election law, the defendants contend that the courts should construe the law to afford the voter who could not anticipate his disability on election day the opportunity to vote. The law makes no provision for this contingency. Section 2464(b) provides that the absentee voter may only receive an absentee ballot when he \u201cexpects\u201d to be prevented from personally going to the polls. This contemplates that the Election Commissioner must anticipate the return of the ballot to protect it and to deliver it to the precinct officials. Presumably the Election Commissioner may deliver ballots received late, Section 2469, before the polls close, but he has no authority to accept applications for ballots on election day. All such absentee ballots which were applied for and issued on election day and voted are illegal.</p>\n    <p id=\"b158-5\">Contestants\u2019 Exhibits 7A and 7B are envelopes which had contained accepted ballots. It is conceded in the briefs that one was sworn to before the registrar of a school and the other before the secretary of the District Administrator at Majuro, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. We do not take judicial notice of foreign law but it does not appear that the registrar of a school is authorized to administer oaths and the Trust Territory is not a state, territory or municipality within the United States. We again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>point out that we have no authority to construe a statute so liberally in favor of the voter as to substitute entirely different safeguards for those provided in it. These ballots were improperly cast.</p>\n    <p id=\"b159-3\">VOTERS\u2019 IDENTIFYING MARKS</p>\n    <p id=\"b159-4\">A number of ballots were introduced in evidence which contained markings other than those authorized. Section 2390 provides that a voter shall not place any mark upon his ballot by which it may afterwards be identified as the one voted by him. The trial court rejected some of these and accepted others. In doing so, the court followed the general rule of liberal construction indicated by Section 2519. There may be some doubt as to whether, in rejecting some of these ballots, the court was as liberal toward the voters as is intended by Section 2522, which provides as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b159-5\">\u201cSec. 2522. Unauthorized marks on ballot. No mark upon a ballot which is unauthorized by this title invalidates a ballot, unless it appears that the mark was placed there by the voter for the purpose of identifying the ballot.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b159-6\">The court in such a situation, however, is faced with a difficult decision on very meager evidence as to the intent of the voters. While it is possible that we might differ as to the effect of the markings on individual ballots, particularly as there were so few of them as to make any deliberate improper intent unlikely, we must follow the trial court where, as here, we recognize there is ample room for a difference of opinion.</p>\n    <p id=\"b159-7\">OTHER IRREGULARITIES</p>\n    <p id=\"b159-8\">There are many other irregularities on the part of the election officials which do not involve the integrity of the voters. Such officials are required by the election manual to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>have the voters sign a roster before receiving a ballot. It was shown that in one precinct the voters\u2019 names were marked off and in another that one person signed for all voters. This is another example of unnecessary safeguards thrown around the election. In this community it is highly improbable that a fraudulent voter could present himself to election officials without being discovered and no such fraud was shown by the contestants. We must clearly distinguish between irregularities which are the fault of the voter and those which are the fault of election officials.</p>\n    <p id=\"b160-5\">SUMMARY OF FACTS</p>\n    <p id=\"b160-6\">According to Exhibit 37, the results found by the trial court, the 21 candidates of one party received a total of 117,480 votes and the 21 candidates of the other party a total of 107,728 votes. The individual who received the highest vote had 5,798 votes among the candidates of the winning party and the highest vote for the losing party was 5,359. The lowest vote for a successful candidate was 5,362. We surmise that irregularities took place in other elections but that the results were not sufficiently close to warrant a contest. There is no evidence of fraud or collusion to aid or hinder any candidate, nor is there any evidence of a pattern for identifying ballots by any particular method. There is no indication that any one voted who did not have a right to provided he or she had done it in the proper manner and at the proper time. Of the total number of ballots voted there may be about 100 illegal ballots, or less than one percent. Neither this court, nor any other court, can determine whether the elimination of illegal ballots would have changed the results. Furthermore, it would not only appear that both political parties acquiesced in the acceptance of most of these illegal ballots, but it is clear that the workers of both parties actively cooperated in obtaining at least some of them.</p>\n    <p id=\"b161-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>THE LAW</p>\n    <p id=\"b161-3\">There are four points of law which it seems to us most important to consider in this case.</p>\n    <p id=\"b161-4\">1. In the first place the Guam Election Law does not appear to us to be really as ambiguous as counsel have claimed. It is true there are a number of inconsistencies between the literal wording and implications of certain of the sections and those of others, but this is likely to be true in any lengthy and detailed legislation dealing with a number of situations. It is the duty of all concerned to make a reasonable effort to reconcile such statements and ascertain the real substance of the legislative will. In doing this one of the most widely recognized principles is that the more specific provisions shall control over general ones or the implications that might otherwise be drawn from the general provisions, 50 Am.Jur., Section 367. If this principle is kept clearly in mind, many of the ambiguities alleged by counsel should give no one serious trouble. It is on this basis that we believe the absentee ballots issued on election day must be held to have been illegal.</p>\n    <p id=\"b161-5\">2. It should be borne in mind that, according to the great weight of authority, there is a sharp distinction between the effect to be given provisions of an election law if enforcement is sought before the election and the effect to be given after the election. Before the election practically all the provisions will be considered as mandatory and all concerned should make an honest effort to comply with them; but after the election all will ordinarily, in the absence of any express statutory provision to the contrary, be held directory only, in support of the r\u00e9sult, unless the variations from them are such as to interfere either with the honest expression of opinion of the electorate or with the honest ascertainment of the result. The crucial question at that point is one of fairness and honesty. The great inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>'est of the public in avoiding the expense and inconvenience of a new election and fairness to those who have lawfully voted require that the will of the electorate shall not be thwarted or delayed by mere honest misunderstandings or inadvertent errors of the election officials or others which do not indicate any fraud or any intention to improperly aid or hinder any candidate, 18 Am.Jur., Elections, Sections 11 and 225; <em>Cameron v. Babcock </em>(S.D. 1935) 262 N.W. 80, 101 A.L.R. 650. This principle makes what we have referred to as \u201cother irregularities\u201d above, of no consequence in the present case.</p>\n    <p id=\"b162-5\">3. Now we come to the troublesome question of how the situation should be handled when illegal votes have been cast in good faith, without any fraud or collusion, in sufficient number to possibly affect the result of the election, but it is not known for whom the votes were cast.</p>\n    <p id=\"b162-6\">The trial court and, before that, the judge supervising the recount, attempted in certain instances, to offset an unidentified illegal ballot by withdrawing a ballot from the precinct ballot box and deducting the votes therein from the totals of the candidates for whom the vote was cast, apparently by analogy to the situation covered by Section 2505, but we find no warrant for this procedure in either the election law or the decisions that have come to our attention. There appears to be only one instance in which a ballot properly cast can be removed from the ballot box in any such manner. Section 2505 provides that if the number of ballots in the box exceeds the number of names on the tally list, the excess number of ballots shall be withdrawn and destroyed by the precinct judge. It does not appear that this procedure affected the result, and it may therefore be disregarded as harmless error. Since, however, we hold that the unidentified absentee ballots issued on election day were also illegal, it is still important to determine how they should be treated.</p>\n    <p id=\"b163-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Different jurisdictions within the United States have adopted different rules on this matter. A few would either void the whole election or void the election in the precinct or district in which such votes were cast, if they were confined to one district. The majority, however, hold that in such a situation the contestant has the burden of proving for whom the illegal votes were cast and that these would affect the result \u2014 in the sense of who won, and not merely changing the margin of victory \u2014 that, if the contestant does not sustain this burden, he must fail, and that the proper course is then to prorate the improper ballots in proportion to' the votes cast for each candidate or to ignore the fact that illegal votes have been cast, viz. 155 A.L.R. 677; <em>In re Sugar Creek Local School District </em>(Ohio 1962), 185 N.E.2d 809:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b163-3\">\u201cIf the legality of the votes cast is attacked upon grounds not affecting the vote of the entire precinct, it must be proved for whom the illegal votes were cast; and where it is not possible for either party to prove how the alleged illegal votes affected the result, the contestants having the burden of proof must fail.\u201d 18 Am.Jur., Elections, Section 303.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b163-4\">In the Sugar Creek case the court made an extensive review of the decisions in other states as to whether and when the rule to be applied is that the contestant must prove for whom the illegal votes were cast and that they would affect who won, or is that it is sufficient to void the election if the contestant merely proves there were illegal votes cast in sufficient number so that they might affect who won. In the course of this review the court stated at page 819:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b163-5\">\u201cIn the following states both rules are applied: California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. If the irregularities are great and flagrant, the election is voided, if they are found not to be great and flagrant, even though there was uncertainty as a result, the contestant was held to prove the illegal votes and for whom they were cast.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Then at page 820 the court summarized the situation as follows :</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b164-5\">\u201cThus, it will be seen out of 33 states directly passing upon this issue, nine require that a contestant shall prove his case as in any other case, including the actual vote; four held that it is only necessary in any circumstances to prove the illegal vote and the uncertainty of the election; and twenty apply both rules according to the facts in the case before them \u2014 the distinguishing mark being whether there was fraud or whether the irregularities are great or flagrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b164-6\">In our present case, we believe that the irregularities, though participated in by many, cannot properly be considered either \u201cgreat <em>or </em>flagrant\u201d as those words are used by the courts in this connection and certainly not \u201cgreat <em>and </em>flagrant\u201d which are the words used in stating this dividing line in the first of the above quotations. \u201cFlagrant\u201d here, we take to connote a bad intent and to be used in the sense defined in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Second Edition, as \u201cFlaming into notice; notorious; enormous, heinous; glaringly wicked; as a flagrant error, traitor.\u201d</p>\n    <p id=\"b164-7\">Section 2602 provides that no irregularity or improper conduct by the precinct election board shall void an election result unless this resulted in a defendant being declared either elected or tied for election; and Section 2603 provides that an election shall not be set aside on account of illegal votes unless it appears that such number of illegal votes has been given to the person whose right to the office is contested, or who has been certified as having tied for first place, which if taken from him, would reduce the number of his legal votes below the number of votes given to some other person for the same office, after deducting therefrom the illegal votes which may be shown to have been given to such other person. This is at least consistent with, if it does not require, placing upon the contestants the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>burden of proving who the unidentified illegal votes were for under the circumstances here disclosed. These unidentified illegal absentee ballots seem to have been so generally accepted in different precincts that we believe any prorating of them would have to be on the, basis of each candidate\u2019s, total vote and not by precincts. Therefore, it makes no practical difference whether they are prorated or the fact of their illegality is simply disregarded, viz. <em>Russell v. McDowell </em>(1890) 83 Cal. 70, 23 P. 183, where prorating on the basis of the entire vote was used.</p>\n    <p id=\"b165-4\">We therefore hold that the contestants have not sustained their burden of proof and that the complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b165-5\">4. While we base our decision on the above, we feel we should also call attention to the fact that by their failure to challenge the illegal \u2018local\u201d absentee votes in accordance with Section 2477 when they were cast and by the participation of the Territorial Party\u2019s workers in obtaining some of them, the contestants may well have been estopped to object to them, <em>In re Sugar Creek Local School District, </em>supra; 18 Am.Jur., Elections, Section 280.</p>\n    <p id=\"b165-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n    <p id=\"b165-7\">We conclude that the contestants have not shown that the defendants, or any of them, were improperly elected.</p>\n    <p id=\"b165-8\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

On April 12, 1976, as a result of FNSP\u2019s failure to repay a loan, a judgment was entered against FNSP in favor of the Bank of Hawaii for $5,628.82. No part of that judgment had been paid as of June 3, 1976, when De Castro presented for collection to the Bank of Hawaii a check drawn to his order in the amount of $1,500.00. A teller, in verifying that the drawer\u2019s account contained sufficient funds to cover the check, learned that appellee had guaranteed FNSP\u2019s debt to the bank. The bank then applied the $1,500.00 to the debt.</p>\n    <p id=\"b510-13\">De Castro brought an action in the Superior Court, alleging that the application of the check to the debt constituted conversion, and moved for partial summary judgment. The Superior Court, finding no legal justification for the bank\u2019s action, granted this motion. The court held that the language of the surety agreement barred the bank from. applying money of the borrower to its guaranteed indebted<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>ness, and that the action of the bank was not justified under the banker\u2019s lien of Guam Civil Code \u00a7 3054. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the decision of the Superior Court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b511-3\">Two issues are presented on appeal. The first concerns the proper construction of the following sentence within the guaranty instrument:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b511-4\">You [the bank] are authorized to apply against indebtedness of the Borrower other than that guaranteed hereby any monies of Borrower paid or available to you.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b511-5\">Appellee urges the court to construe this sentence to mean that the bank may not apply funds to indebtedness of the borrower guaranteed by appellee. Appellant, on the other hand, contends that the sentence gives it the option to credit funds of the borrower either to his guaranteed debts or to other debts that are not guaranteed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Superior Court, stating that the language of the clause is clear on its face and that the agreement must be strictly construed against the bank, accepted appellee\u2019s construction and held that the bank\u2019s action in taking the check was tortious.</p>\n    <p id=\"b511-6\">This court does not find that the language of the sentence is clear on its face. The instrument is poorly drafted since, depending upon the emphasis given to the words of the sentence, either of the constructions urged by appellee or appellant could be understood. Thus the court must interpret these words so as to resolve the ambiguity and give effect to what it believes was the intention of the parties when the contract was entered. 4 Williston On Contracts \u00a7 618 (3rd ed. 1961).</p>\n    <p id=\"b511-7\">In resolving this ambiguity, the context in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>sentence appears must be considered. The clause cannot be taken alone, but must be examined \u201calong with all the other words by which it is surrounded; also along with . . . the nature of the business in hand, the purposes of the parties to the transaction, and the other relevant circumstances.\u201d 3 Corbin On Contracts \u00a7 549 (1960).</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b512-5\">Disproportionate emphasis upon a single provision does not serve the purpose of interpretation. Words, phrases and clauses are not to be isolated but related to the context and the contractual scheme as a whole, and given the meaning that comports with the probable intention. <em>Mantell v. International Plastic Harmonica Corp., </em>141 N.J.Eq. 379, 55 A.2d 250 (1947).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b512-6\">Considering the guaranty instrument as a whole, it becomes apparent that De Castro\u2019s construction of the sentence makes no sense. His construction denies to the bank its right to apply funds of the borrower to the guaranteed debt. This takes away much of the bank\u2019s ability to collect on the debt in case of default; it also, in most circumstances, would work to the disadvantage of the guarantor, since the bank would not be able to apply funds of the borrower to its guaranteed indebtedness and relieve the guarantor of liability to that extent.</p>\n    <p id=\"b512-7\">Moreover, the position of the clause within the instrument is also a relevant consideration. Assuming, arguendo, that appellee\u2019s construction of the sentence is correct, then the character of the sentence is entirely different from that of all others within the paragraph. With the exception of the sentence in question, which is the last one in the paragraph, this long paragraph contains only provisions which are advantageous to the bank. It does not seem plausible that a provision, which grants a significant advantage to the borrower, would be tacked on at the end of a paragraph which enumerates various important rights of the bank. This seems especially true since the instrument here is a form document prepared by the bank.</p>\n    <p id=\"b513-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Therefore, the court does not find it reasonable for De Castro, under these circumstances, to have given the sentence in question the meaning he claims he understood. The interpretation urged by the bank appears to be the most reasonable, and that meaning is the one to which legal effect can justly be given. We thus hold that the clause under consideration was intended to enable the bank to apply funds of the borrower to debts other than those guaranteed by De Castro, and avoid relieving De Castro of liability to the bank to the extent of the funds applied to these other debts.</p>\n    <p id=\"b513-3\">Appellee urges this court to adopt his construction of the sentence because of the doctrine of contra proferentem. This is the rule that, when there is doubt as to which of several possible meanings is to be given to the words of a contract, the words should be construed most strongly against the party who chose them. However, this doctrine is invoked only as a last resort after all ordinary interpretative guides have been exhausted and two or more reasonable interpretations of the language in question remain. <em>Hurd v. Illinois, </em>136 F.Supp. 125, 134 (N.D. Ill. 1955); 3 Corbin On Contracts \u00a7 559 (1960). Since appellee\u2019s construction of the language in question is not reasonable in the context of the present contract, and since other interpretative guides lead to the conclusion that appellant\u2019s construction of the phrase is correct, it is not appropriate for the court to apply the rule of contra proferentem.</p>\n    <p id=\"b513-4\">The second issue on appeal concerns the Superior Court\u2019s holding that the bank\u2019s action was not justified under Guam Civil Code \u00a7 3054. The court found that the statutory banker\u2019s lien does not apply in this case since De Castro was neither a \u201ccustomer\u201d nor a \u201cdepositor\u201d of the bank. We hold, however, that in the circumstances of this case, the word \u201ccustomer\u201d in \u00a7 3054 applies to the appellee, and therefore the action of the bank was justified.</p>\n    <p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>De Castro became a \u201ccustomer\u201d of the bank when he induced it to extend credit to FNSP by offering to guarantee its loans to FNSP. A direct commercial relationship was thus created between them. Moreover, when FNSP defaulted on its loan, De Castro, as guarantor, became a debtor of the bank to the amount of FNSP\u2019s obligation. <em>Melander v. Western Natl. Bank, </em>21 Cal.App. 462, 468, 132 P. 265 (1913). Thus, on June 3, 1976, when appellee presented the check to the bank for collection, he was both a guarantor of the debts of one of its borrowers, and a debtor of the bank.</p>\n    <p id=\"b514-5\">Under these circumstances the court finds that appellee is a \u201ccustomer\u201d under Guam Civil Code \u00a7 3054. The purpose of \u00a7 3054, to enable banks to collect on debts in default, is more readily served by allowing this flexible and reasonable interpretation of the word \u201ccustomer.\u201d</p>\n    <p id=\"b514-6\">Therefore it is ordered that the decision of the Superior Court is reversed and that judgment be entered for appellant.</p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n      <p id=\"b511-8\"> The effect of such a provision would be to avoid that principle of suretyship law whereby the guarantor is relieved of liability to the bank as to any funds of the borrower that come into the bank\u2019s possession and are not applied by it to the guaranteed indebtedness.</p>\n    </footnote>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

In answer to the first question submitted as to whether the Trial Court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motions to quash the information on the ground that no offense was charged because only acts at one time were charged as constituting vagrancy, while it is clear that at common law vagrancy was a continuing offense, it is also clearly within the power of the Legislature to enlarge the definition of vagrancy. The Guam Legislature has done this, and in Section 647 of the Penal Code has set forth the offense in terms far more comprehensive than the common law meaning of vagrancy.</p>\n    <p id=\"b58-10\">At common law, and under most of the provisions of Section 647, a single act is not sufficient to constitute' a person a vagrant, but in each case the statute must be read in order to determine whether it requires more than a single act to be committed. Certain acts are of such a nature as to reasonably justify an inference that no one not of lewd or dissolute character would do the act even once. In a prosecution for vagrancy where the charge is based on Subdivision 5 of Section 647 of the Penal Code, as is applicable in this case, relating to lewd and dissolute persons, and the evidence shows such a single act, the question of the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>ference to be drawn therefrom of a continuing act is for the Trial Court. <em>People v. Scott, </em>113 Cal.App. (Sup.) 778 (1931). <em>People v. Babb, </em>103 C.A.2d 326 (1951).</p>\n    <p id=\"b59-3\">As to the second point raised by the appellant; namely, whether the Court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, made on the ground that the testimony of the accomplice was not corroborated as required by Section 1111 of the Penal Code of Guam, we hold that the accused\u2019s confession constituted sufficient corroboration. See 20 Am.Jur., Evidence, Sec. 1237, p. 1089.</p>\n    <p id=\"b59-4\">The judgment of the Island Court of Guam is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

We reserved decision for a careful review of the law as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>pertains to (1) obligations of sureties and (2) discharge of a surety\u2019s obligations. Section 2840 of the Civil Code of Guam provides that a surety is exonerated:</p>\n    <p id=\"b391-3\">1. In like manner with a guarantor;</p>\n    <p id=\"b391-4\">2. To the extent to which he is prejudiced by any act of the creditor which would naturally prove injurious to the remedies of the surety or inconsistent with his rights, or which lessens his security; or</p>\n    <p id=\"b391-5\">3. To the extent to which he is prejudiced by an omission of the creditor to do anything when required by the surety which it is his duty to do:</p>\n    <p id=\"b391-6\">Exoneration \u201c. . . in like manner with a guarantor\u201d due to creditor dealings with debtor is explained by Civil Code Section 2819:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b391-7\">a guarantor is exonerated, except so far as he may be indemnified by the principal, if by any act of the creditor, without the consent of the guarantor, the original obligation of the principal is altered, in any respect, or the remedies or rights of the Creditor against the principal, in respect thereto, in any way impaired or suspended.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b391-8\">Both parties agree that Plaintiff, Bank of Hawaii, on- 21 April, 1975, mistakenly issued the third increment check, in the amount $6,412.50, to AJB Construction and to Defendant. This check should have been issued to Defendant and Perez Brothers Inc., because of an irrevocable assignment from AJB to Perez which occurred on 21 October, 1974. Defendant endorsed the check over to \u00c1JB assuming that the assignment debt to Perez had been cleared since Perez\u2019 name was left off the check and since Defendant had had no notice of the further claims of Perez (which were billed later). Plaintiff\u2019s mistake opened the door for AJB to claim the entire' check without paying Perez since all protections were gone.</p>\n    <p id=\"b391-9\">\u25a0 Defendant, China Insurance, was prejudiced in several ways by the action of Plaintiff. Defendant, having notice of the -AJB to Perez assignment, was entitled thereafter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>rely on properly designated Bank increments to pay off Perez if any supplier\u2019s claim existed regardless of whether the bond was in fact a performance or payment bond. The Plaintiff, despite having had notice of the said assignment, proceeded to deal with the assignor albeit unintentionally. The resulting premature payment to AJB considerably lessened Defendant\u2019s security, thereby injuring Defendant in a manner similar to the fact setting in <em>Glenn County v. Jones, </em>146 C. 518, 80 P. 695 (1905). Soon after it received that third increment check AJB defaulted. \u201cThe pressure which would have been exerted upon him to continue the performance of his contract . . . was removed when he received the money\u201d <em>(Glenn County </em>at page 696). Defendant was compelled to perform by finding a replacement contractor. The Plaintiff, Bank of Hawaii, paid later checks to the substitute contractor (amount $6,344.75) and to Perez Brothers (amount $4,311.77) because claims by both were preventing the owner, Mr. Salas, from entering the new residence. No invoice inspection was made by Plaintiff as to materials late-billed by Perez Brothers prior to issuing the 21 October, 1975, check.</p>\n    <p id=\"b392-5\">Plaintiff suggests that where two parties are equally at fault, a balancing of equities compels the surety to pay since this is the whole purpose for Plaintiff requiring a bond in the first instance. We neither agree that there is equality of fault nor that a balancing approach is proper. Nor does the law of Guam hold a surety liable when, a creditor has so acted negligently. The Civil Code of Guam Section 2840 exonerates the surety that is prejudiced in the manner described above. While it is true that Defendant, with more diligence, might have realized the Bank\u2019s error and denied endorsement on the third increment check, we do not believe it was Defendant\u2019s obligation to so double-check the actions of the Bank. It was reasonable for Defendant to rely on the Plaintiff\u2019s careful response to the AJB to Perez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>assignment, and the law of this territory exonerates the Defendant from liability for this $2,175.52 loss by Plaintiff.</p>\n    <p id=\"Aag\">Plaintiff\u2019s demand for relief is denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b393-3\">Submit order.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The motion was heard on September 14, 1978, and decision was reserved.</p>\n    <p id=\"b613-20\">Defendants contend, first of all, that only incompetent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>evidence was submitted to the grand jury on a crucial element of the offense charged. They maintain that Officer O. J. Herradura\u2019s testimony identifying the substance alleged to be marijuana was improperly received by the grand jury under \u00a7 50.42 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b614-5\">Officer Herradura identified the substance in question on the basis of the Duquenois-Levin reagent test, the field test that he performed on the scene. The defendants argue that this identification was incompetent because Officer Herradura had not been qualified as an expert before the grand jury, and therefore his testimony as to the field test would have been inadmissible at trial.</p>\n    <p id=\"b614-6\"> The Court finds this argument'unpersuasive. Prior to his testimony about the field test, Officer Herradura testified that he had been specializing in drug cases for almost two years and that he had received training in recognition and identification of various drugs, <em>particularly marijuana. </em>In <em>People v. Olf, </em>195 C.A.2d 97, 15 Cal. Rptr. 390 (1961), the court, in response to an argument that, certain exhibits were improperly received by a grand jury,, stated: \u201cAt the trial of the action, there is no doubt that a better foundation would be laid for the introduction of' such exhibits than was laid at the proceedings before the-grand jury, but the failure to establish a technical foundation for their admission before that body does not render such exhibits inadmissible.\u201d 195 C.A.2d at 104. It is well-established that the qualifications of an expert are within the purview and discretion of the judge. See <em>People v. Ignacio, </em>413 F.2d 513 (1969). It is not this Court\u2019s opinion that the Attorney General\u2019s Office could not have done a better job; rather, the Court states only that the minimum foundational requirements for the admission of the field test were met.</p>\n    <p id=\"b615-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>The grand jury must find an indictment when there is reasonable cause to believe an indictable offense has been committed and that the defendant committed it. See Criminal Procedure Code \u00a7 50.45(b). The Court notes that Officer Herradura\u2019s testimony was not the only evidence linking the defendants with the substance alleged to be marijuana. See testimony of Tomas T. San Nicolas, Transcript of the Grand Jury Proceedings, August 17, 1978. Having carefully reviewed the grand jury transcripts, the Court finds that there was reasonable cause for the grand jury to return an indictment against the defendants herein.</p>\n    <p id=\"b615-3\"> The defendants also contend that the prosecutors improperly argued and made prejudicial misstatements to the grand jury. In many instances, there is a fine line between explaining and arguing. The Court agrees that the grand jury should not be used as a mere tool of the prosecution. However, the function of a grand jury is not to find guilt or innocence, and therefore the proceedings should not be turned into the technical equivalent of a trial. Section 50.46 of the Criminal Procedure Code does not impose on the prosecution the burden of doing as good a job as a defense attorney in attempting to negate defendant\u2019s guilt. The Court does not find that the prosecutors\u2019 presentation before the grand jury was so incompetent or prejudicial as to invalidate the indictment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b615-4\">These same principles apply to the defendants\u2019 last contention, that evidence as to the quantity of the substance was prejudicial. The court feels that the matters brought up in defendants\u2019 argument would be much more appropriately handled at trial.</p>\n    <p id=\"b615-5\">Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss the Indictment is therefore hereby DENIED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b615-6\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The relevant code sections for analyzing this issue in controversy are Sections 406.1 and 405 of the Civil Code. Briefly, these sections allow for jurisdiction to be obtained over a foreign corporation \u201cdoing business in Guam\u201d by serving process on the Director of Revenue and Taxation where such a corporation has not, pursuant to Section 405, designated an individual residing in Guam to accept summons and process. .</p>\n    <p id=\"b317-11\">The operative words which fashion the gravamen of defendant\u2019s motion are those of \u201cdoing business in Guam\u201d. Succinctly stated defendant\u2019s contention is that it has never been doing business in Guam and therefore is not subject to Civil Code Section 406.1.</p>\n    <p id=\"b317-12\">\u201cDoing business\u201d as a legal phrase of art has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>construed countless times by almost every court including the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>McGee v. International Life Insurance Co., </em>355 U.S. 220 (1957). This phrase has been traditionally defined in terms of \u201cminimum contacts with the forum state so that maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\u201d. <em>International Shoe Co. v. State of Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310 (1945). Equally traditional in terms of adoption by other jurisdictions as a definition for this phrase is what it must consist of:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b318-5\">An act done or transaction consummated in the forum state or some other act by which the defendant purposely avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws. <em>Hanson v. Denckla, </em>357 U.S. 235 (1958).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b318-6\">Applying these definitions to the case at hand it would seem from the fact that the contract was entered into in Guam, that the services which were the subject matter of the contract were rendered in Guam, that there were numerous meetings between the parties on Guam, and that there were continuous correspondence and communications between the plaintiff on Guam with the defendant, that these activities of the defendant could be said to constitute sufficient \u201cminimum contacts\u201d as to fall within the nearly universal definition of doing business. See <em>Ault v. Dinner for Two, Inc., </em>27 Cal.App.3d 148 (1972).</p>\n    <p id=\"b318-7\">With respect to defendant\u2019s allegation that the Superior Court is without subject matter jurisdiction, the court merely asserts that per operation of Section 55 of Public Law 12-235 it is vested with subject matter jurisdiction over this matter.</p>\n    <p id=\"b318-8\">For the foregoing reasons the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b318-9\">Submit order.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Plaintiffs made a $3,000.00 deposit, balance being $58,000.00. Section 27 of the contract contained standard terms providing that on default by the plaintiffs, defendant could retain the $3,000.00 deposit as liquidated damages. The contract expressly provides in Section 25 that the seller \u201cmakes no warranty of completion by any specified date.\u201d Section 24 of the contract provides that this contract states the entire agreement. Plaintiffs, relying on statements made by agents of defendant, expected to be able to move into the house in May or June of 1974. In fact, the house was not ready for occupancy until October 7, 1974, see Exhibit B to defendant\u2019s answer. Plaintiffs never signed papers for the house, and it apparently was sold by defendant for an unknown amount to another buyer on defendant\u2019s waiting list. Plaintiffs filed suit on October 18, 1974, alleging that defendant intentionally deceived plaintiffs to induce them to enter into the contract and that plaintiffs entered into the contract in reliance on said representations. Plaintiffs pray for return of $3,000.00 deposit and rescission of the contract. Depositions of plaintiffs were taken and defendant filed an answer denying fraud. Plaintiffs filed an opening brief. Defendant filed an answering brief to which plaintiff replied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b335-3\">On June 27, 1975, the parties stipulated that matters in dispute be submitted to the court on the depositions and briefs of the parties.</p>\n    <p id=\"b335-4\">I</p>\n    <p id=\"b335-5\">\n      <em>Fraud</em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"b335-6\">An analysis of the evidence before the court fails to establish plaintiffs\u2019 claim that fraud was committed by defendant which induced plaintiffs to enter into the contract. Given the difficulties faced by contractors on Guam in obtaining materials, tools, equipment and appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>anees, Sections 24 and 25 of the contract, noted above, were reasonable. Any oral statements concerning completion date made by employees or agents of the defendant were in the nature of opinions or predictions and did not bind the defendant, particularly, in view of Sections 24 and 25 of the contract which the plaintiffs admitted they understood. See transcript of deposition of Elfriede B. Couey, page 19, and transcript of deposition of Ronald Couey, pages 13 and 14. In this connection, it should be noted that one of the plaintiffs had professional real estate experience. \u201cThe law presumes fair play, it does not presume fraud or mistake of fact. These are matters which must be established by the party claiming them.\u201d 12 Cal. Jur.2d, Contracts, Section 53, p. 253. This the plaintiffs have failed to do. Consequently, relief must be denied the plaintiffs on their allegation of fraud.</p>\n    <p id=\"b336-3\">II</p>\n    <p id=\"b336-4\">\n      <em>Penalty</em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"b336-5\">Counsel for plaintiffs in his reply brief contends that he is entitled to return of the $3,000.00 deposit on the ground that such sum is a penalty rather than provision for liquidated damages and relies on Sections 1670 and 1671 of the Civil Code of Guam, although this ground for relief from penalty is not alleged in his complaint.</p>\n    <p id=\"b336-6\">The plaintiffs are wilfully defaulting vendees. By a series of cases interpreting Sections 1670, 1671, 3275, 3307 and 3369 of the Civil Code of California, the Supreme Court of California has improved the position of a wilfully defaulting vendee so that a wilfully defaulting vendee can now recover his deposit from the seller if he proves that the seller\u2019s damages were less than the amount the seller retained. For a case directly in point see opinion of Justice Traynor in <em>Baffa v. Johnson, </em>216 P.2d 13, 35 Cal.2d 36 (1950). The California Code sections, cited above, are the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>same as the identically numbered sections in the Civil Code of Guam, therefore, we hold that <em>Baffa v. Johnson </em>is controlling and we follow its ruling. For discussion of rights of wilfully defaulting vendees and <em>Baffa v. Johnson, </em>see <em>The California Land Contract, </em>48 Calif. L. Rev. 729 (1960); and <em>The Supreme Court of California </em>(1970-1971), 60 Calif. L. Rev. 705, 975 (1972).</p>\n    <p id=\"b337-3\">As noted in the statement of facts, there was no evidence of the resale price of the property by the defendant nor was there any other evidence showing that the defendant\u2019s damages were less than the amount of plaintiffs\u2019 deposit, to wit: $3,000.00. Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for relief on the ground that the $3,000.00 deposit was a penalty must be denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b337-4\">Judgment will be entered for the defendant.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The car owned by Juanita P. Quitugua was being driven by Jose P. Quitugua, her son, at the time of the accident.</p>\n    <p id=\"b377-6\">2. The car owned by Frankie C.

We sit as an appellate court under the authority of Part I, Title I, Chapter II of the Guam code of Civil,Procedure and Public Law 85-444, 85th Congress, approved June 4, 1958, 72 Stat. 179. The Trust Territory justices were duly assigned by the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit under the authority vested in him by P.L. 85-444.</p>\n    <p id=\"b45-4\">We deal with this appeal at some length because the question presented concerns the right of Guam residents to be free from unlawful arrest, searches and seizures. The gambling for small stakes is admitted and after the conviction the Island Court merely warned the appellants and levied court costs.</p>\n    <p id=\"b45-5\">The time element is confused but the essential facts are that the Government of Guam owns apartments which.are rented to its off-island employees for whom it provides housing. These apartments are located in the general area which contains the Guam Memorial Hospital, a general hospital maintained and operated by the Government of Guam. In the early morning hours of December 21, 1957 a nurse at the hospital directed another employee to call the police because it had been reported to her that calls for help were coming from the apartments. In due course this became garbled so when the two policemen arrived they were told to investigate a non-existent disturbance in the hospital parking lot. They heard loud talking, coming from an apartment rented by one of the appellants in which he and five guests were engaged in playing small stake poker. One of the policemen drew near and heard the word \u201craise\u201d and the sound of money. They reported this nefariousness to their headquarters, which report brought to the scene the police officer in charge of the vice squad. He listened and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>satisfied himself that gambling was in progress. The apartment was located on the second floor of a multiple apartment dwelling. Although three police officers were then present, no arrests were made at that time, the reason being that it was necessary to organize a raid.</p>\n    <p id=\"b46-5\"><em>And then I went </em>back and told the boys to stand by and they were going in to that apartment. On the second trip I took the boys up to the apartment and I am the first one to come into the premises, Tr. p. 31.</p>\n    <p id=\"b46-6\">It took about an hour to organize the raid. The raiding officers approached the apartment and the raid leader testified that he looked in and saw the poker game in progress. He knocked on the door and immediately entered the unlocked room. Cards and money were taken as evidence. The players were taken to the police station, booked and released. The amount of money in front of the individual players varied from a few cents to a few dollars. The Government dignified these trivia by filing a formal information against them. They moved for suppression of the evidence and the trial court set the motion for hearing but the appellants offered no evidence to support it. The trial court properly overruled it. At the trial, however, numerous motions were made along the same line when it became clear as to what had happened.</p>\n    <p id=\"b46-7\">The Government of Guam was created by the United States Congress through the Organic Act of Guam, 48 U.S.C.A. 1421 et seq. It was provided with a Bill of Rights which was taken from the United States Constitution. Section 1421b(c), corresponding to Amendment IV of the Constitution, provides:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b46-8\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated; and no warrant for arrest or search shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b47-3\">We know of no reason why the Guam Bill of Rights should not be construed, within the framework of applicable local laws, as providing the same restraints on Guam law enforcement officers, as those restraints which are imposed by similar provision in the Constitution on federal law enforcement officers. This view' is further strengthened by the fact that in the Organic Act the Congress made the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure applicable to the District Court of Guam, Section 1424(b), which rules in part implement the Constitutional restrictions. The District Court has jurisdiction over local felonies, and 1424(a)</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b47-4\">. . . The jurisdiction of and the procedures in the courts of Guam other than the District Court of Guam shall be prescribed by the laws of Guam.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b47-5\">In its Summary of Findings and Recommendations of the Subcommittee on Improvements in the Federal Criminal Code, of the Committee on the Judiciary United States Senate (Report No. 1478, April 28, 1958) the subcommittee stated, pp. 13 and 14:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b47-6\">The subcommittee is not convinced that the extent and nature of other Federal crimes are such as presently to justify further liberalization of the rules governing search and seizure. In this connection we must say that the rules restricting the police do not exist simply to protect us against the inconvenience of police intrusion.

Freedom from the sudden, unjustified \u201cknock on the door\u201d is a most precious liberty.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b47-7\">No search warrant was obtained or sought. The appellee claims that the seizure without a warrant was justified as incident to lawful arrests for a misdemeanor committed in the presence of the police, while the appellants\u2019 basic claim is that the arrests were illegal.</p>\n    <p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Under the Penal Code of Guam an arrest may be made by a peace officer without a warrant for a public offense committed or attempted in his presence.</p>\n    <p id=\"b48-5\">836 \u2014 ARREST BY PEACE OFFICERS. A peace officer may make an arrest in obedience to a warrant delivered to him, or may, without a warrant, arrest a person:</p>\n    <p id=\"Ady\">1. For a public offense committed or attempted in his presence.</p>\n    <p id=\"b48-7\">2. When a person arrested has committed a public, offense, although not in his presence.</p>\n    <p id=\"b48-8\">3.

When there is a reasonable cause to believe that he has committed or is about to commit a public offense.</p>\n    <p id=\"b48-11\">He may not make an arrest at night for a misdemeanor except when the offense is committed in his presence.</p>\n    <p id=\"b48-12\">840 \u2014 ARRESTS, WHEN MAY BE MADE. WITHOUT WARRANT, WHEN. If the offense charged is a felony, the arrest may be made on any day, and at any time of the day or night. If it is a misdemeanor, the arrest cannot be made at night, unless upon the direction of the magistrate, indorsed upon the warrant or except when the offense is committed in the presence of the arresting officer.</p>\n    <p id=\"b48-13\">He may break open the door or window of the house after having demanded admittance and explained the purpose for which admittance is desired.</p>\n    <p id=\"b48-14\">844 \u2014 ARRESTS, ENTRIES FOR. To make an arrest, a private person, if the offense be a felony, and in all cases a peace officer, may break open the door or window of the house in which the person to be arrested is, or in which they have reasonable grounds for believing him to be, after having demanded admittance and explained the purpose for which admittance is desired. A peace officer who has witnessed the commission of a public offense may pursue the offender into any ship, building, or grounds.</p>\n    <p id=\"b49-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>The evidence in this case showed that no demand for admittance was made. The arresting officer knocked and entered through an unlocked door.</p>\n    <p id=\"b49-3\">If the police raid had proceeded on the basis of the information in the possession of the officers immediately before the officer saw the poker game in process, it would have been illegal. In <em>McDonald v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 451, the defendant was conducting a numbers operation in his room in a rooming house. He had been under police observation for about two months. Three officers surrounded the house and one entered by prying open a window in the landlady\u2019s room, after which he admitted the other officers. One of the officers stood on a chair and looked through a transom where he saw the defendant and evidence of the numbers game. Search was made as incident to the arrest. The Supreme Court held that the search was illegal without a warrant in that there was ample time to obtain a warrant even after the officer saw the offense being committed. The concurring opinion of Justice Jackson made a distinction between lawful and unlawful entry to the rooming house. He stated, p. 458.</p>\n    <p id=\"b49-4\">Doubtless a tenant\u2019s quarters in a rooming or apartment house are legally as well as practically exposed to lawful approach by a good many persons without his consent or control. Had the police been admitted as guests of another tenant or had the approaches been thrown open by an obliging landlady or doorman, they would have been legally in the hallways. Like any other stranger, they .could then spy or eavesdrop on others without being trespassers. If they peeped through the keyhole or climbed on a chair or on one another\u2019s shoulders to look through the transom, I should see no grounds on which the defendant could complain. If in this manner they, or any private citizen, saw a crime in the course of commission, an arrest would be permissible.</p>\n    <p id=\"b49-5\">There was no evidence in the present case that access to the apartment door involved any trespass.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The right without a search warrant contemporaneously to search persons lawfully arrested while committing crime and to search the place where the arrest is made in order to find and seize things connected with the crime as its fruits or as the means by which it was conducted, as well as weapons and other things to effect an escape from custody is not to be doubted, <em>Agnello v. United States, </em>269 U.S. 20-30.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-5\">In spite of the disproportionate zeal of the Guam police, we are forced to the conclusion that the arrest was legal in this case. The trial court believed that the police officer had seen the gambling in process before making an entrance and that the offense was therefore committed in his presence. This was the first occasion when the evidence would have justified an arrest and seizure.</p>\n    <p id=\"b50-6\">The convictions are affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

N. Ofeciar and Enrique S. San Nicolas are children, heirs, and devisees of Antonio S. N. San Nicolas. Enrique was appointed administrator of his father\u2019s estate in 1953. In 1970 his father\u2019s will was admitted to probate and Enrique was appointed executor. After the death of Enrique in 1971 Ana was appointed administratrix.</p>\n    <p id=\"b238-9\">The will devised the middle portion of Lot 94-1, Talofofo to Enrique. This appeal arises out of a hearing on the petition for partial distribution of the appellee seeking distribution of Lot 94-2 (sic), Talofofp to the Estate of Enrique. The appellant Ana S. N. Ofeciar as administratrix objected to the distribution on the grounds that no survey had been made of the assets of the estate, that title to some assets was uncertain, and thus injury to the estate could result from the granting of the petition.</p>\n    <p id=\"b238-10\">It is apparently uncontested that Ana S. N. Ofeciar and Pedro Ofeciar erected improvements on that portion of Lot 94, Talofofo, which was devised to Enrique.</p>\n    <p id=\"b238-11\">This appeal arises out of a hearing (extending over several days and including a view of the property by the court) at which by agreement only one issue was litigated. The'issue was whether the Ofeciars had made the improvements in good faith and with the express or implied consent of Enrique. The evidence was conflicting.</p>\n    <p id=\"b238-12\">The court resolved this issue in favor of the Estate of Enrique and the finding is supported by evidence. There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>no basis for this court to say that the finding was clearly erroneous. Section 64 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n    <p id=\"b239-3\">Affirmance of this finding does not conclude the matter. Before the trial court is the petition for partial distribution. The trial' court should make appropriate findings and conclusions of law, and enter its order as required by Section 1001 of the Probate Code.</p>\n    <p id=\"b239-4\">Affirmed and remanded to the Superior Court of Guam for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Provision for jury trials was required by the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968).</p>\n    <p id=\"b275-15\">P.L. 10-2 was effective February 3, 1969. The central question raised by the motions is whether this law was intended as an interim measure or not. I conclude that it was. P.L. 9-256 which enacted a new Sec. 123 of the Code of Civil Procedure provided that the Judicial Council prescribe rules, but such rules should not become effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>until 90 days elapsed after the reporting of such rules to the Legislature. Prior to P.L. 10-2 the Court had Rules of Criminal Procedure, but no rules at all regarding jury trials. Pending prescription of rules by the Judicial Council and the passage of 90 days prior to their effectiveness, P.L. 10-2 filled this need for rules governing jury trials.</p>\n    <p id=\"b276-5\">Giving support to the view that P.L. 10-2 was an interim measure is</p>\n    <p id=\"b276-6\">(1) the wording of the act itself which does not \u201crepeal\u201d Sec. 123;</p>\n    <p id=\"b276-7\">(2) the fact that the Attorney General of Guam and the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the Legislature were both members of the Judicial Council, present at meetings where the rules were decided upon, and who, in their respective roles, worked in concert with the decisions of the Judicial Council; and</p>\n    <p id=\"b276-8\">(3) the history of the rules prescribed, by the Judicial Council and reported to the Legislature after the enactment of P.L. 10-2 and the retention of Sec. 123 following the effective date of P.L. 10-2. These latter matters are summarized below.</p>\n    <p id=\"b276-9\">On April 25,1969, the Judicial Council adopted rules and on April 30, 1969, the chairman of the Judicial Council reported proposed rules to the Legislature. The Legislature failed to annul or amend any rule (see Sec. 123, Code of Civil Procedure), and they became effective after 90 days. This failure to act constitutes approval by the Legislature. On July 31, 1969 the rules were filed with the Secretary of Guam and a notice given that the rules were in effect.</p>\n    <p id=\"ASuU\">It is conceded in argument that until very recent date these rules, published in the Penal Code of Guam, 1970, beginning on page 325 were assumed to be in effect. They were invoked by counsel and cited by the Court in Island Court cases. <em>People v. Santos, et al., </em>Case No. 144-71; <em>People v. Lizama, et al., </em>Case No. 349-69.</p>\n    <p id=\"b277-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>The terms of Sec. 123 state that any law in conflict with the rules after their effective date shall have no further effect. This provision would nullify P.L. 10-2 once rules were prescribed, reported and became effective.</p>\n    <p id=\"b277-3\">Section 123, as enacted by P.L. 9-256, was amended by P.L. 10-180, effective August 15,1970, and by P.L. 11-151, effective July 13, 1972, thus demonstrating that the Legislature did not repeal Sec. 123 by P.L. 10-2.</p>\n    <p id=\"b277-4\">These rules then fall within the specific language of Sec. 66 of the Code of Civil Procedure enacted by P.L. 12-85, effective July 1,1974. They were prescribed by the Judicial Council and reported to the Legislature. The rules entitled Rules of Criminal Procedure for the Island Court of Guam, published in the Penal Code on page 325, by authority of Sec. 66, became the Rules for this Court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b277-5\">In reaching this result the following principles of statutory construction have been applied:</p>\n    <p id=\"b277-6\">1. The best construction of a statute is the construction and application received by the Legislature, the Courts and the profession, and such construction should not be disturbed or overturned except for cogent and convincing reasons. 73 Am.Jur.2d, Statutes, Sec. 162.</p>\n    <p id=\"b277-7\">2. Where two constructions are possible, the Legislature is presumed to intend the beneficial consequences, and not the undesirable consequences. <em>Ibid., </em>Sec. 258.</p>\n    <p id=\"b277-8\">3. It is presumed that the Legislature knew of the construction, long acquiesced in, and intended the same construction when the provision was re-enacted. (Referring to Sec. 123, now Sec. 66 of the Code of Civil Procedure) <em>Ibid., </em>Sec. 322.</p>\n    <p id=\"b277-9\">4. Where statutes are inconsistent, the last one passed is presumed to be the last declaration of Legislative will, and should prevail. <em>Ibid., </em>Sec. 332.</p>\n    <p id=\"b277-10\">5. Resort to legislative history is permitted no matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>how clear the words may appear on superficial examination. <em>Ibid., </em>Sec. 150.</p>\n    <p id=\"b278-5\">The motions to dismiss are therefore denied.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Both defendants were represented by Timothy Stewart and the plaintiff was represented by John Dierking.</p>\n    <p id=\"b668-13\">Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is based on an allegation of defective service on defendant Lee Chung Sook by service on her attorney-in-fact, Mr. Paulino. This motion is essentially the same as that raised previously by counsel for defendant by a motion to quash service, and was decided adversely to defendant in the Court\u2019s decision of April 3, 1979.

However, the affidavit by which he seeks to establish this fact was not served with the motion as required by Rule 6 (d), or ten (10) days in advance of the hearing as required by Rule 56(c). In this case there is no prejudice to the plaintiff for the plaintiff does not seek to contradict the affidavit or allege that due to the shortened time he has been prejudiced in obtaining evidence to contradict the affidavit. (See Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Civil Section 2719 (1973).) In fact, both parties have stated that based on such an affidavit they would stipulate to a dismissal, albeit on different terms. In this case either continuing the matter or denying the motion with leave to refile it would only serve to waste judicial resources, and as the plaintiff has claimed no prejudice to his rights, the summary judgment motion as to defendant Paulino is hereby GRANTED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b669-3\">The final motion outstanding in this matter is plaintiffs\u2019 motion for default judgment. Such a motion is addressed to the discretion of the Court (see Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Section 2685 (1973)) and based on the record in this matter the motion is DENIED.

They assigned other errors but on oral argument it was agreed that the appeal would be limited to their contention that the type of activity engaged in did not constitute a violation of law. The appellants operated a bottle club. Club members kept their individual bottles of liquor on the premises for their use and the use of. their guests. The club sold no liquor but sold ice and non-alcoholic mixers. The club had the proper license to sell such nonalcoholic mixers. The question before us is as to whether this type of operation violated the Government Code of Guam. We requested additional briefs in an effort to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>mine whether the provisions to be discussed were taken from any state statute, but no additional briefs have been furnished.</p>\n    <p id=\"b38-5\">Section 25100 of the Government Code of Guam provides :</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b38-6\">Except as authorized in this title a person shall not import, manufacture or sell alcoholic beverages without a license.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b38-7\">Section 25020 provides:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b38-8\">\u201cSell includes:</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b38-9\">(a) Transferring title to alcoholic beverages by one person to another for any consideration but not the retransfer of title by the latter to the former.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b38-10\">(b) Keeping or serving alcoholic beverages in connection with the sale or service of any other substance by one person to another for any; consideration.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b38-11\">(c) Soliciting and receiving orders for alcoholic beverages.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b38-12\">(d) Keeping, offering or exposing for sale alcoholic beverages.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b38-13\">Section 25124 provides for club licenses and the sale of liquors to club members</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b38-14\">and shall also authorize any bona fide club member to keep in his private locker on such premises a reasonable quantity of liquor, if owned by himself, for his own personal use and not to be sold, and which may be consumed only on the premises.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b38-15\">However, under Section 25008</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b38-16\">\u201cClub\u201d means an organization which operates an establishment for objects of an athletic, patriotic, political or social nature and not for pecuniary gain, having a bona fide membership list, the majority of members of which pay dues at least once in every year.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b38-17\">Although the corporate appellant uses the word \u201cClub\u201d in its name, it could not have qualified for a club license since it is a profit making corporation. The evidence showed that such profit was derived from the sale of ice and mixers at a price roughly equivalent to that which would have been charged for mixed alcoholic drinks, but by its attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>to circumvent the liquor regulation, it could remain open at times when on the premises sale liquor establishments must close. The courts do not encourage such devices. As stated in part in 48 C.J.S. p. 389</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b39-3\">It is generally agreed that, if the pretended club is a mere device to evade the license laws, with no principle of selection as to membership, and with no real purpose but to provide its frequenters with a convenient method of obtaining a drink whenever desired, it conducts an illicit traffic.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b39-4\">It is our conclusion that the appellants both kept and served alcoholic beverages in connection with the sale or service of any other substance within the meaning of Section 25020(b) of the Government Code of Guam, supra. Police officers testified that on an occasion previous to the raid, confiscation of over 200 bottles of liquor and the arrests, they had entered- the club premises as guests. Their hostess promptly left them. One of the club waiters placed a bottle of liquor on their table. They ordered three small bottles of soft drinks, water and ice, for which they paid $2.50 (Tr. pp. 23 and 24).</p>\n    <p id=\"b39-5\">The confiscated liquor was found in various places in a locker, on the bar and on tables in an adjacent room (Tr. p. 5; Gov. Exh. 3 and 5).</p>\n    <p id=\"b39-6\">Courts will refuse to countenance any trick or subterfuge intended to evade the law against the illegal sale of intoxicating liquor. (30 Am.Jur. 413.) A fairly recent case illustrates this principle, <em>State v. Perry, </em>246 Iowa 861; 69 N.W.2d 412. The defendant in the <em>Perry </em>case operated a club. Police officers, previously unknown to the defendant paid a membership fee and paid for a bottle of liquor which was given a number. They then bought drinks. The court held that this was not a club but a public drinking establishment. The furnishing of liquor in connection with the sale of food by a hotel or boardinghouse keeper is regarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>as a sale of liquor, 30 Am.Jur. 410. In the case before us we have a profit making club which supplied a dance orchestra and remained open when licensed establishments were required to close. The evils that licensing regulations are intended to correct could readily be circumvented if the courts sanction the operation of such a drinking establishment. It differs from licensed establishments only in that its customers must anticipate their drinking by providing liquor to be kept by the club and made available as required. This is clearly the type of subterfuge which the law will not countenance.</p>\n    <p id=\"b40-5\">The convictions are affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The plaintiff alleged it was the lessor in a sublease agreement assigned to the defendant Fashions, Inc.; that the defendant Carol Webb was an officer of her co-defendant; that there was default in the payment of rent due under the sublease and failure to perform a covenant in the lease requiring that the premises be insured with the plaintiff. The defendant Carol Webb filed a motion to dismiss the complaint as to her on the ground, in substance, that it failed to state a cause of action against her. The defendant Fashions, Inc. filed an answer, first counterclaim, second counterclaim, and cross-complaint. The Island Court denied defendant Carol Webb\u2019s motion to dismiss and, on motion of the plaintiff, dismissed defendant Fashions, Inc\u2019s, counterclaims and cross-complaint in advance of trial. The appellants filed a notice of appeal from the order covering these matters, but in spite of this the Island Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>proceeded with the trial on the date set for it. The defendants took no part in the trial, although duly notified of the time for it. The Island Court then entered judgment awarding the plaintiff possession, treble rents and damages against both defendants, forfeiture of the sublease, and costs. The defendants filed a new notice of appeal from this judgment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b65-3\">We believe that the first notice of appeal was premature since the order attempted to be appealed from was not a \u201cfinal\u201d judgment or order within the meaning of that word with regard to appeals. The question is well settled, as stated in <em>Arnold v. Guimarin &amp; Co., </em>263 U.S. 427, at page 434:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b65-4\">\u201cIt is well settled that a case may not be brought here by writ of error or appeal in fragments; that to be reviewable a judgment or decree must be not only final, but complete, that is, final not only as to all the parties, but as to the whole subject matter and as to all the causes of action involved; and that if the judgment or decree be not thus final and complete, the writ of error or appeal must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. <em>Hohorst v. Packet Co., </em>148 U.S. 262, 264; <em>Collins v. Miller, </em>252 U.S. 364, 370; <em>Oneida Navigation Corporation v. Job, </em>252 U.S. 521, 552, and cases therein cited.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b65-5\">See also 2 Am.Jur., Appeal and Error, Secs. 17 and 21; <em>Budke v. Kaiser-Frazer Co. </em>(1960), 275 F.2d 217. The Island Court was therefore justified in proceeding with the case, but the issues attempted to be raised by the first notice are still open under the notice of appeal from the judgment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b65-6\">The Island Court clearly erred, however, in not granting defendant Carol Webb\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint as against her and in rendering judgment against her. We cannot see how the complaint can properly be construed as setting forth any cause of action against her personally.</p>\n    <p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>We agree with the appellee\u2019s basic contention that in an unlawful detainer proceeding the defendant is not entitled to claim any affirmative relief, either by counterclaim or by cross-complaint, and that Section 442 of the Guam Code of Civil Procedure does not apply in unlawful detainer cases in view of the provisions of Section 1170 of the Guam Code of Civil Procedure with regard to this particular type of proceeding. It was the obvious intent of the Legislature that this type of proceeding shall be summarily disposed of separate from other controversies between the parties, as is the usual practice under similar legislation in the United States. <em>Arnold v. Krigbaum </em>(1915), 169 Cal. 143; 22 Am.Jur., Forcible Entry and Detainer, Sec. 42, note 20.</p>\n    <p id=\"b66-5\">We are firmly of the opinion, however, that Section 475 of the Guam Code of Civil Procedure does apply in unlawful detainer cases and that the Court, in accordance with that section, must disregard errors in the pleadings which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties. While defendant Fashions, Inc\u2019s, counterclaims and cross-complaint brought in many extraneous matters, the second counterclaim and the cross-complaint both clearly brought to the attention of the Court that the defendant claimed to have been evicted by the plaintiff from portions of the subleased property. This matter would have been more properly pleaded as a defense in the answer itself and the trial court might well have required the defendant Fashions, Inc., to amend its answer to include this matter. We fully concur with the appellee and the trial court that a proceeding for unlawful detainer is not a proper place to consider the general matter of balancing equities between the parties or granting an accounting or exploring any matters not directly connected with the question of whether the defendant\u2019s possession is unlawful. We think the court below erred, however, in entirely dismissing the second counterclaim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>and the cross-complaint without preserving in some manner the defendant\u2019s right to be heard on this issue of partial eviction and that disregarding technicalities, as required by Section 475 of the Code, the Island Court should have allowed any defense such as this, whether legal or equitable, going to the very question of whether the defendant\u2019s possession was unlawful, to be fully explored at the trial. <em>Schubert v. Lowe </em>(1924), 193 Cal. 291; <em>Simon Newman Co. v. Lassing </em>(1903), 141 Cal. 174.</p>\n    <p id=\"b67-3\">If the defendant is able to show that it was actually evicted from any substantial part of the leased premises, this would, in our opinion, bar the plaintiff\u2019s right to the rent and other benefits stipulated in the sublease and bar its right to relief through the summary procedure of unlawful detainer. The lessee would, in such a situation, still have the right, if it so elected, to remain in possession of the part of the premises from which it had not been evicted, but its obligation to pay for the use and occupation of such part of the premises as it retained would depend upon quantum meruit. The defendant should not be expected, at its peril, to estimate the exact amount due under pain of possible further eviction through a proceeding for unlawful detainer. <em>Skaggs v. Emerson </em>(1875), 50 Cal. 3.</p>\n    <p id=\"b67-4\">Because of the errors set forth above, this Court does not feel it necessary to comment upon the other matters raised in this appeal.</p>\n    <p id=\"b67-5\">In accordance with the order of this Court, in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, the defendants have paid into the Registry of the District Court of Guam-substantial sums of money to secure the plaintiff\u2019s right to payment of rent, if due, or in quantum meruit for use and occupation of the premises. From all indications, even if the appellant\u2019s claims are correct, at least a substantial part of the monies on deposit is due the plaintiff. We believe that an attempt should be made to determine summarily what part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>this is clearly due the plaintiff and that such amount should be released to it and only a sufficient amount retained in the Registry of the Court to protect the rights of the defendant Fashions, Inc.</p>\n    <p id=\"b68-5\">The judgment of the Island Court, and so much of its order of February 6, 1958 as relates to the defendant Carol Webb, and to the second counterclaim and the cross-complaint, are hereby set aside. The funds now held in this action in the Registry of the District Court of Guam are ordered transferred to the Registry of the Island Court of Guam and this action is remanded to the Island Court with the following instructions:</p>\n    <p id=\"b68-6\">A. To enter judgment dismissing the complaint as against the defendant Carol Webb with costs.</p>\n    <p id=\"b68-7\">B. To grant the remaining parties in the action an opportunity for a summary hearing, in advance of trial, as to the amount of the funds now in the Registry of the Court which can fairly and safely be released to the plaintiff and, at the same time, retain sufficient funds to protect the defendant from overpayment of whatever amounts may be found due in quantum meruit if defendant\u2019s contentions as to eviction from part of the premises are ultimately sustained.</p>\n    <p id=\"b68-8\">C. To grant the defendant Fashions, Inc., a new trial in accordance with the foregoing opinion.</p>\n    <p id=\"b68-9\">Due to his retirement, Judge Manibusan has taken no part in this opinion.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Abbate on July 24, 1979. The Government was represented by Assistant Attorney General Paul Pohlen, defend\u00e1nt Anthony Flores was represented by Stephen Cronin, and defendant Raymond Quidachay was represented by Assistant Public Defender Richard Pipes. Defendant Quidachay moved for severance of defendants in this matter, and co-defendant Flores joined in the motion by moving to reconsider a previously denied motion for severance.</p>\n    <p id=\"b680-9\">Defendants\u2019 motion is based on \u00a7 65.35 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and the Organic Act of Guam (48 U.S.C. Section 1421(b); <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620 (1968)). The gravamen of defendants\u2019 complaint is that a joint trial will result in prejudice, deny them the right of confrontation of witnesses against them, and deny them due process of law in that each defendant has allegedly made extrajudicial statements which would be admissible against the defendant who made the statement, but not against the other.</p>\n    <p id=\"b680-10\">Guam Criminal Procedure Code \u00a7 65.35 is textually the same as Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14, and direct reference to this rule is made in the Code as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>source of \u00a7 65.35. A motion made under this Section is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Parker v. Randolph, </em>99 S.Ct. 2132 (1979); <em>Opper v. United States, </em>75 S.Ct. 158, 165, 348 U.S. 84, 95 (1954).</p>\n    <p id=\"b681-3\">In the instant case, there are several claims that prejudice will result if severance is not granted. The first, of course, is that evidence would be admitted at a joint trial, albeit with a curative instruction that it may not be used against the co-defendant who did not make the statement, which would not be admissible if the co-defendant\u2019s trial was severed, and without benefit of cross-examination. It is argued by the Government that this is a case such as <em>Parker v. Randolph, </em>supra, in which the co-defendant has himself made an incriminating statement, and thus lessened the prejudice of admitting his co-defendant\u2019s statement. <em>Parker </em>is inapposite on its facts for two reasons: First, defendant Flores has allegedly made not one confession, but several which inculpate his co-defendant Quidachay to varying degrees, and increase the confusion the jury would be subjected to in hearing these confessions and attempting to excise any probative effect on the guilt or innocence of the defendant who did not make the confession. Second, the oral statement attributed to defendant Quidachay in the view of the Court stops short of being a complete confession as to all of the elements of the offense with which he is charged, and is clearly inconsistent with one or more of the confessions made by Flores. Thus, we do not have, as in <em>Parker, </em>a situation in which \u201cthe defendant himself has confessed and his confession \u2018interlocks\u2019 with and supports the confession of his co-defendant\u201d.</p>\n    <p id=\"b681-4\">A second factor raised by defense counsel is \u201cthe possibility that at a separate trial a co-defendant would give exonerating testimony\u201d, <em>People v. Massie, </em>66 Cal.2d 899, at 954.</p>\n    <p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>And finally, joint trial in this case raises the spectre of comment on the failure of the co-defendant to take the stand by counsel for a defendant. <em>(De Luna v. United States, </em>308 F.2d 140), thus raising prejudicial error as to the nontestifying defendant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b682-5\">For the foregoing reasons, it is the decision of the Court that it is in the interest of justice that trial in this matter be severed as to each defendant. Jury selection for defendant Flores is set for the original date set for a joint trial, August 10, 1979, 9:00 a.m. Jury selection as to defendant Quidachay is set for 9:00 a.m., August 24, 1979.</p>\n    <p id=\"b682-6\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Section 80.60(a) (2) states that:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b598-11\">(a) Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (b), the court shall dismiss a criminal action if: * * * (2) The trial of a defendant, who is in custody at the time of his arraignment, has not commenced within forty-five days after his arraignment. . . .</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b598-12\">Defendant was arraigned on June 9,1978, and trial commenced on August 10, 1978. There was thus a sixty-two-day period between arraignment and trial. However, dismissal of a criminal action under \u00a7 80.60(a)(2) is not mandatory. Rather, it is qualified by \u00a7 80.60(b), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b598-13\">(b) A criminal action <em>shall not be dismissed </em>pursuant to Subsection (a) if: * :|: * (3) <em>Good cause is shown </em>for the failure to commence the trial within the prescribed period. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b599-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>This court finds that there was good cause for not commencing the trial within the period prescribed by \u00a7 80.60(a)(2), in that a key prosecution witness, Ms. Yamato, was unavailable to testify due to injuries she suffered as a victim of the alleged crime. This being the case, defendant\u2019s motion must be denied insofar as it is based upon \u00a7 80.60(a) (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code.</p>\n    <p id=\"b599-3\">The delay occasioned by Ms. Yamato\u2019s unavailability also causes defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment challenge to fail. The U.S. Supreme Court, in <em>Barker v.

Why they assembled Is left a mystery, but we do know that those assembled had certain things in common. All in the group were laborers brought to the Island from the Philippines. They were part of the labor force of Guam which far away from homeland and families worked on government projects by day and sought to take the edge off loneliness and idleness in off hours. Despite this common bond, there was a factor of disunity. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>group assembled on one side of the village street was quartered at the Marbo Labor Camp, while their co-workers facing them on the opposite side were Rojas Camp boys. To the observer this might seem trivial, but like sailors of two different ships meeting in a beer hall such differences albeit arbitrary in origin proved ample grounds for a free-for-all.</p>\n    <p id=\"b34-5\">The appellants, eleven in number, consist of Marbo and Rojas contestants of this fight who appeal from the judgment of the Island Court of Guam, wherein they were jointly convicted of committing a riot. Pursuant to this conviction the court has imposed upon each appellant a fine of Fifty Dollars. The appellants assign seven specifications of error. We find that specifications one through six have no merit. Specification 7 cites a ground of basic error in that the evidence presented was not sufficient to support a conviction of riot under the applicable statute. Section 404 of the Penal Code of Guam defines the crime of riot as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b34-6\">Any use of force or violence, disturbing the public peace, or any threat to use such force or violence, if accompanied by immediate power of execution, by two or more persons acting together, and without authority of law, is a riot.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b34-7\">A review of the record discloses that the acts for which the appellants- were convicted are covered within the scope of Section 404 with the exception of the term \u201cacting together.\u201d The application of this concept must be understood in the context of its common law meaning. Our research has not revealed any significant treatment by American courts of the subject. However, cases in other common law jurisdictions have considered the question, and we find their reasoning persuasive.</p>\n    <p id=\"b34-8\">In the Indian case of <em>Regina v. Mazhur </em>Hassein, 5 N.W. 208 (1873), reported in 15 (replacement) <em>The English and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number><em>Empire Digest, </em>case *4968, the members of two separate groups were convicted of rioting. One group consisted of not less than five persons. They as well as their opponents came armed with sticks prepared to fight and did fight. Held: they were not improperly convicted of rioting, their common object being to assault their opponents.</p>\n    <p id=\"b35-3\">As to the other groups, the court found that they had no object in common with the first and were therefore not part of the same riot. This group consisted of four persons. The fight did not occur in a public place. Held: they were not properly convicted of rioting; had the fight occurred in a public place it might have been held that the common object of both parties was to commit an affray.</p>\n    <p id=\"b35-4\">Another decision that contending forces in a common melee do not constitute a single riot is the Canadian case of <em>Regina v. Corcoran, </em>26 Upper Canada Common Pleas Reports 134 (1876). There a religious procession was attacked by rioters. Corcoran, one of the processionists, separated himself from his fellow marchers and fired a pistol above the heads of the attacking rioters. Corcoran and fourteen of the attackers were indicted on a charge of riot, on which charge he and nine others were convicted. On appeal the conviction of Corcoran was reversed. While his actions might be punishable in themselves they do not merge with those of the rioters simply because they are in response to the rioters\u2019 attack. His actions stood alone and since he was not proved to be acting in concert with anyone there was no evidence to support a conviction of riot. As we read the opinion, the court states further without deciding that had Corcoran been joined in his acts of violence by some of his fellow processionists this group could have itself been convicted of a separate riot.</p>\n    <p id=\"b35-5\">The facts which face us here outline the dimensions of a common gang fight. It cannot be maintained that in such an affray the participants exhibit a community of interest to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>achieve an established goal. Instead it is the fight per se which is the goal, and in such a fight there are two contending forces each with its own ends to accomplish. Both groups cannot be indicted for a single riot.</p>\n    <p id=\"b36-5\">We further note that although these appellants received modest fines, the punishment for riot under Section 405, Penal Code of Guam, may extend to imprisonment not exceeding one year or by fine not exceeding $200 or both. The offense of disturbing the peace under Section 415 of the Penal Code may be punished by fine not exceeding $50 or by imprisonment for not more than sixty days or both. This difference indicates the more serious nature of riot and the care which must be exercised in distinguishing it from other disturbances. The statutes of Guam clearly lay before us the elements of the crime of riot. While disturbances such as appellants here participated in are injurious to the public peace we must conclude from a reading of the facts that all the required elements specified have not been met.</p>\n    <p id=\"b36-6\">We find that the judgment of the Island Court of Guam must be reversed and the conviction set aside.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Her plea of not guilty was conditioned upon her contention that the offense was committed upon a military reservation under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States of America. For many years some question existed as to the extent, if any, of the jurisdiction of the government of Guam over criminal offenses committed on military reservations in Guam. Any doubt was removed by the passage of Pub. L. 88-183, Nov. 20, 1963, 77 Stat. 339, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1704.

The testator had property in Guam, and an administratrix was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>appointed with the will annexed. The appellant filed a petition in the Island Court for an accounting, determination of heirship, and objection to distribution on behalf of herself and other alleged heirs similarly situated, in which she contended that the petitioners were entitled to share in the decedent\u2019s estate for the reason that they had interests in the estate by virtue of the property interests of Alice Webb Herrero, the first wife of the decedent who died in 1936. The basic contention is that the Civil Law of Spain was in effect in Guam until 1933; that under that law a system of forced heirs gave the children of the first marriage vested rights in the conjugal property; that such vested rights could not be taken away without violating prohibitions against the taking of property without due process of law. The Court below filed a memorandum opinion, with which we are in accord, disposing of these contentions.</p>\n    <p id=\"b106-5\">It is unquestioned that the first wife died in 1936. As of May 1,1933, a new Probate Code became effective in Guam. Section 200 of that Code provides:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b106-6\">\u201cSuccession\u201d is the acquisition of title to the property of one who dies without disposing of it by will.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b106-7\">Section 201 provides:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b106-8\">Upon the death of either husband or wife, one-half of the community property belongs to the surviving spouse; the other half is subject to the testamentary disposition of the decedent, and in the absence thereof goes to the surviving spouse, subject to the following provisions.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b106-9\">Under the clear terms of this statute the husband, in the absence of testamentary disposition by the deceased wife, became the sole owner of the community property.</p>\n    <p id=\"b106-10\">It is clear that neither the common law nor the civil law will be resorted to in order to determine who takes property of <em>a </em>decedent in a situation covered by the statute, 16 Am.Jur. 785.</p>\n    <p id=\"b107-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>In support of this view, Am.Jur. cites <em>Harrison v. Harrison, </em>21 N.M. 372, 155 P. 356, L.R.A. 1916E, 854, a former civil law jurisdiction, wherein the Court stated that the statute was intended to provide for the distribution of all intestate estates and, since 1852, \u201cit has not been necessary here to resort to either the civil or common law to determine who takes the property of decedents.\u201d We hold, as did the Court below, that in 1936 the provisions in the Probate Code governed the descent and distribution of the community property and that it is not necessary to go behind the statute.</p>\n    <p id=\"b107-3\">The appellant refers us to Civil Case No. 6-55, District Court of Guam, entitled <em>Felix Calvo v. Juan T. Martinez, et al. </em>Regardless of the merit or lack of merit of that opinion, it is of no help in this case. In <em>Calvo </em>the claim was made that the mother died in 1929 when the Civil Law was in effect; that under that law Felix Calvo had been vested with certain property rights as a forced heir of the deceased mother. The father had been permitted to manage the conjugal estate until his death. He made a will in which he willed the property to one heir, to the exclusion of the other. The father had never remarried and Felix Calvo was not guilty of laches in not enforcing his rights sooner, for the reason that it was to be expected that the father would deal fairly with his children. The basic distinction between <em>Calvo </em>and the instant case is that in <em>Calvo </em>the rights of forced heirs vested immediately upon the death of the mother. In this case the law had been changed prior to the death of the mother. To hold that forced heirs acquired vested rights at the time of their birth to any property in existence or to be acquired by their parents would lead to utter confusion in land titles and would prevent the sovereign from making the necessary statutory changes to modernize the laws of descent and distribution. Most assuredly, the appellant has been guilty of laches, taking no steps to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>protect any interest she may have had until after the death of the decedent in 1956. The decedent had remarried and had children by the second marriage. We affirm.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The Plaintiff appeared with his attorney, Mr. William Anderson. The Defendants appeared through their attorney, Mr. Herman Skipper, Assistant Attorney General.</p>\n    <p id=\"b353-12\">After oral arguments on August 19,1976, the matter was submitted for decision.</p>\n    <p id=\"b353-13\">At the conclusion of oral argument, Defendants conceded that no law in Guam provides for seizure of slot machines apart from a criminal action. Since the seizure of the slot machines on July 17 and July 27, 1976, informations were filed on August 12, 1976, against the Plaintiff. The Defendants in this case now pray that the court not order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>delivery of the slot machines to the Plaintiff-owner pending the disposition of the criminal cases.</p>\n    <p id=\"b354-5\">These seizures were made pursuant to decisions made and orders given by the Chief of the Vice and Narcotics Squad. Nothing in the testimony of the members of the police involved suggests that any arrests were contemplated; the police knew where the machines were located; went to those places and determined that they were used for gambling; and made the seizure. There was no contention in the testimony that the machines were in the possession of the Plaintiff. No summons has been issued to bring Plaintiff before the court to answer the criminal charges. All circumstances indicate that the Government seeks only the confiscation of the slot machines. This, they concede, they have no right to, apart from the criminal action filed subsequent to the seizure.</p>\n    <p id=\"b354-6\">I conclude that Plaintiff has established his right to possession of the 9 slot machines as against the Defendants.</p>\n    <p id=\"b354-7\">Let judgment be entered directing Defendants to return the slot machines to Plaintiff as prayed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b354-8\">JUDGMENT</p>\n    <p id=\"b354-9\">This cause came on regularly for trial on the 13th day of August, 1976, before the Honorable Richard H. Benson, Judge, presiding, sitting without a jury. Plaintiff appeared with his attorney, Mr. William Anderson, and defendants appeared through their attorney, Mr. Herman Skipper, Assistant Attorney General, and evidence both oral and documentary having been presented by both parties and the cause having been argued and submitted for decision and the court having made and caused to be filed its written Memorandum Decision,</p>\n    <p id=\"b354-10\">IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that defendants return to the plaintiff all of the coin-operated amusement devices as prayed for in the complaint.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The appellant wife, who was defendant below, challenges the division of the community property. We hold the trial court abused its discretion and we remand, without reversing, for further findings and conclusions and entry of an amended decree in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n    <p id=\"b221-6\">In its interlocutory decree, the Court awarded divorce to the husband \u201cupon the grounds stated in the complaint\u201d; custody of the three minor children was awarded defendant with support from plaintiff in the amount of $200.00 per month, even though plaintiff agreed to continue paying $400.00 per month (Tr. 12) \u201cas long as I can\u201d; real property in Guam was awarded to plaintiff and the wife was awarded $3,600.00 in monthly installments of $200.00; and an unimproved lot in Florida was awarded plaintiff.</p>\n    <p id=\"b221-7\">The wife appeals on the ground it was ehror to award all of the community property to the plaintiff. Appellant argues the Guam Civil Code, Sections 146 and 147, require sharing of community property, within the Court\u2019s discretion, even when the grounds for the divorce are adultery or extreme cruelty.</p>\n    <p id=\"b221-8\">The so-called \u201cFindings of Facts and Conclusions of Law\u201d prepared by plaintiff\u2019s counsel and entered by the Court do not find facts but merely recite conclusions of law. i.e.:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>\u201cThat the defendant has been guilty of acts constituting extreme cruelty towards the plaintiff, and that such acts have caused plaintiff great mental anguish.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b222-5\">From our examination of the transcript, we do not agree with this conclusion and without findings of facts from the evidence, we are unable to say whether this was reversible error or not as an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    <p id=\"b222-6\">In <em>Galbreath v. Homestead Fire Ins. Co., </em>185 F.2d 361, 364, the Ninth Circuit laid down the rule relating to abuse of discretion as grounds for reversal. A finding of fact is necessary. The court said:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b222-7\">\u201cWhere the trial court sitting without a jury has made a finding upon an issue of negligence it is the duty of the appellate court as a matter of law to determine whether or not the finding is clearly erroneous even in the face of supporting evidence but only after due allowance of respect for the trial court\u2019s conclusion. And it is the appellate court\u2019s duty to reverse if, upon viewing the case as a whole, it is convinced that a mistake has been made.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b222-8\">Because .there are no adequate findings of fact upon which to base the Court\u2019s conclusions, we are unable to say whether or not the Court abused its discretion. In this case, the Court concluded the plaintiff was entitled to a divorce upon the grounds alleged in the complaint. These included an allegation the defendant \u201cdeserted and abandoned\u201d the plaintiff. The evidence is to the contrary.</p>\n    <p id=\"b222-9\">As to the award of property, we again are at a loss to determine whether there was \u201cplain error\u201d because of lack of findings or whether .there was an abuse of discretion contrary to the intent of the statute as appellant argues.</p>\n    <p id=\"b222-10\">The Guam statutes were taken from the California Code prior to their comparatively recent amendments. We look to that state\u2019s decisions against which to measure the decree in the case before us.</p>\n    <p id=\"b222-11\">The trial court cited in support of its award of all real property to plaintiff husband and an award of $3,600.00 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the wife, the California case of <em>Johnston v. Johnston, </em>91 P.2d 142, which holds that \u201cunder various circumstances, an award of money to the wife in lieu of her interest in the real and personal property of the community has been sustained.\u201d</p>\n    <p id=\"b223-3\">Although no finding was made as to the value of the real property awarded to the husband, the evidence is not disputed that the wife contributed $6,200.00 of her separate funds to the improvement of the community realty. The award of $3,600.00 in lieu of her interest in the realty is shockingly disproportionate to her contribution to the community assets, both in money and management services. Without findings of facts to support it, we must conclude the award is an abuse of the Court\u2019s discretion and is therefore contrary to Section 147 of the Guam Civil Code.</p>\n    <p id=\"b223-4\">We also note the wife is cut off from any support after payment of the $3,600.00. The record shows she has twice undergone surgery for cancer and at the time of trial was having monthly medical checkups to ascertain whether further surgery will be necessary. No provision was made in the decree for future medical expenses either for the wife or the three minor children.</p>\n    <p id=\"b223-5\">The evidence shows the wife is without assets of her own, that she is fifty-eight years of age and that it is unlikely she can become gainfully employed. If the wife isn\u2019t now on welfare, the probability is she soon will be. Neither the statute nor the exercise of judicial discretion warrants condemning an erring spouse to the welfare rolls no matter how greatly she may have offended her husband.</p>\n    <p id=\"b223-6\">When there is discretion to award less than half of the community property to one spouse, the exercise of \u201creasonable\u201d discretion must be measured by all of the circumstances affecting the parties. The applicable rule is found in <em>Hill v. Hill, </em>309 P.2d 44, 46:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>\u201cApparently the decisions have embraced the concept that it is proper in such cases to visit punishment upon the erring spouse in the apportionment of community property. Nevertheless, divorce having been granted and the time having arrived for apportioning the community property, the amount thereof, the age of the parties, their physical and mental condition, their ability to support themselves, and the needs of the minors, if such there be, are all matters ranking higher in the scale of importance than the mere infliction of punishment for wrongdoing.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b224-5\">It is true the offending spouse may not receive alimony when the grounds for divorce are extreme cruelty under the pre-amendment California statute, unless the parties have agreed to the contrary. <em>Goldberg v. Goldberg, </em>301 P.2d 51. The record here shows, as we have seen, the trial court failed to grant the plaintiff\u2019s conditional promise to provide support for both his wife and children.</p>\n    <p id=\"b224-6\">A review of the record discloses the findings of facts are so inadequate we cannot know whether the Court\u2019s conclusions were in error or were an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    <p id=\"b224-7\">The evidence shows community property neither valued nor disposed of, nor mentioned in the findings of facts. Because this case must be remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion, it is suggested that the Court make findings of facts on:</p>\n    <p id=\"b224-8\">1. The value of all realty and the rental value of The House of Chin Fee.</p>\n    <p id=\"b224-9\">2. The value of the Florida realty.</p>\n    <p id=\"b224-10\">3. The value of bonds, if any remain in the estate, and if they do not, when and for what purpose they were cashed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b224-11\">4. The value of insurance policies. An order should be made as to their disposition, or their maintenance and continuation for the benefit of the parties and the children.</p>\n    <p id=\"b224-12\">5. The probable cost of future medical expenses. An order should be made to provide for payment of such expenses.</p>\n    <p id=\"b225-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>It is ORDERED that the above-entitled case is remanded to the Island Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Both Island Court judges were involved in these determinations below and are therefore not eligible to assist here. Chief Justice Furber and I constitute a quorum. The facts will be discussed in connection with each individual case. In theory at least we take judicial notice of the laws of Guam under the Naval Government of Guam and of the general history of Guam to the extent that such laws and such history may affect land titles.</p>\n    <p id=\"b141-3\">After sovereignty over Guam was acquired by the United States under the Treaty of Paris from Spain, the government of Guam was placed under the Secretary of the Navy who governed through naval governors. Guam land records do not show any direct grants of land in Guam by the Spanish Crown. There are, however, records of possessory rights \u2014 often translated as \u201cpossession by information\u201d \u2014which have repeatedly been accepted as a proper starting point for title under the Land Title Registration Act.</p>\n    <p id=\"b141-4\">Early naval governors took the position that all land in Guam was the property of the United States because of the failure of inhabitants to prove up their titles to land under Spanish law. This concept was not reduced to practice as value was paid when the naval government had occasion to acquire private land for governmental purposes. However, the naval government was required to pay for governmental services out of local revenue. The early reports of the naval governors to the Secretary of the Navy contain constant complaints over having to use local funds to pay for obligations of the United States, such as the support of the governor\u2019s palace, the support of a leper colony which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>established to protect the military from contact with <em>alleged </em>lepers. Two teachers of English had to be placed on the navy strength as laborers in order to provide this assistance. There were no surveys except as the Naval government was able to make surveys with its limited facilities. There does not appear to have been a land shortage for agricultural purposes so that the average family was only interested in enough land to provide for family needs.</p>\n    <p id=\"b142-5\">Obviously, one of the major necessities confronting the Naval government was to get land claims placed of record for both title purposes and for the collection of taxes. As the naval governor had full legislative and executive authority, he issued Executive Orders having the Force and Effect of Law. We now turn our attention to some of these Orders which appear in No. 38-A, the application of Pedro Atoigue Rojas and Nieves Castro Rojas for initial registration of land.</p>\n    <p id=\"b142-6\">General Order No. 3, August 21, 1899, provided that for the protection of Government interests and as a safeguard for the residents of Guam against speculators and adventurers, the consent of the Government had to be obtained before land could be sold. This concept of governmental approval appears to have existed throughout the Naval government. Any transfer of land had to be approved by a lands attorney who determined whether the grantor had title. As will be noted hereafter, a deed not so approved was not recorded but was maintained in the records for information.</p>\n    <p id=\"b142-7\">General Order No. 15, March 13, 1900, required all owners or claimants to land to register the same by May 15, 1900 or their ownership would not be recognized.</p>\n    <p id=\"b142-8\">General Order No. 23, August 10, 1900, provides, in part, that no public or unclaimed land should be occupied without the written permission of the Governor.</p>\n    <p id=\"b143-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>General Order No. 31, May 23,1901, established a homestead system under which the applicant could obtain a permit, prove up on the land and have title registered in him. It is to be noted that General Order No. 52, March 6, 1903, annuls General Order No. 31 upon the ground that no further concession of public lands to private persons will be made until the Federal Congress shall make provision therefor. We have been unable to find that this legal position was ever changed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b143-3\">General Order No. 42, April 9, 1902, provided that General Order No. 15 was not intended to affect title which had been obtained or could be perfected under the Spanish land law.</p>\n    <p id=\"b143-4\">General Order No. 153, February 28, 1910, amends Article 391 of the Spanish \u201cMortgage Law\u201d and sets up a procedure whereby persons who claim to be in possession of land under such law may prove up their titles. Section 3 provides that after the publication of this order, no transaction affecting real property shall be recorded unless the first record is in accordance with the Order or unless a certificate of survey is attached if the property was recorded previously.</p>\n    <p id=\"b143-5\">General Order No. 181, May 16, 1914, provides that persons occupying land must take steps to prove their rights, that permission to occupy public lands must be obtained from the government; if they do not do so they may not claim reimbursement for improvements made.</p>\n    <p id=\"b143-6\">As will be pointed out hereafter, none of the claims involved herein complied fully with these Naval government requirements. Guam was occupied by Japan. The process of recapturing it involved the destruction of nearly all buildings and most survey markers. The economy changed as the United States took possession of large land areas for housing the destitute and for developing the military bases. This was done by the Navy and subsequently the effort was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>made to survey the land taken, determine ownership and pay just compensation. Land was leased for use by contractors and rental payments were based upon surveys approved by the owners to whom rental was to be paid. These combined economic developments resulted in large increases in land values and the undoubted effort on the part of some to split up the public domain. It is of course the responsibility of the present government of Guam to oppose any effort to obtain title to land through court proceedings if the public interest is not fully protected.</p>\n    <p id=\"b144-4\">All of the proceedings herein were brought under the provisions of the Land Title Registration Act, 1157, et seq., Civil Code of Guam. This Act was taken from California, where it failed, and future registrations were eliminated. It is noted that Section 1157.107 which provided for a Title Assurance Fund, was repealed by P.L. 5-88, 5th Guam Legislature, effective March 15, 1960, so that the Guam law lacks one of the essentials for a true Torrens system. While the owners of a lesser estate may bring the land within the Act, Section 1157.4, the fee simple title must first be registered, Section 1157.6. The questions presented here are as to whether the petitioners have shown that they are the owners in fee simple of the land in question as against the contention of the government of Guam that no fee simple titles were shown. One adjacent property owner contested the claim of the petitioner and this will be considered in due course.</p>\n    <p id=\"b144-5\">\n      <em>I. Application of Jesus Anderson Iglesias, Civil No. S7-A.</em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"b144-6\">The court below decreed that the land should be registered in the name of the applicant over the opposition of the government of Guam and, in part, of Patricia L. G. Ignacio, Administratrix of the estate of Teresa S. Leon Guerrero, deceased. We first dispose of the claim of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Administratrix that the application includes part of the land belonging to the estate. We agree with the court below that this adverse claim must fail; These lands were agricultural lands when taken over by the Navy to provide facilities for a large cost plus contractor. The Navy caused a survey to be made upon which survey the tracts of the claimants appeared. The claimants approved the survey by signing the map. The Navy then paid rentals for the land based upon the survey and approvals. After the land was turned back, the Administratrix attempted to show that the prewar ownership included part of the petitioner\u2019s land as agreed to on the Navy map. The court below held against this as it is readily apparent that to hold otherwise would open the door to continued litigation. The Administratrix was well aware of the area included in the map and is bound by it.</p>\n    <p id=\"b145-3\">The United States was joined as a party but was dismissed on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. The government of Guam admits that the petitioner is entitled to have registered title to approximately 3 hectares of land as against the 6 hectares plus found by the trial court.\u2019 We point out that our agreement with the trial court is limited to the facts of this particular case. The title is first established in 1901 by a rough description of the land. The land was taken temporarily by the Navy and rentals paid for its use. While the government questions the use of Exhibit 8, the first professional survey of this area, this map shows not only the entire area but individual surveys. The petitioner approved this survey. Certainly this approval did not show title in him, but the map also contains numerous surveys of land listed as belonging to the Naval Government of Guam. These were approved by the Attorney General for that government. Later, after the land had been turned back, the petitioner requested that the tax rolls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>of the government of Guam be changed to increase his tax assessment in accordance with the survey. This was done with the approval of the government of Guam, through its attorney general. No question was presented until this petition was filed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b146-4\">The government in its brief has cited ample authority to show that in special circumstances where the boundaries are not reasonably clearly indicated, 3 hectares cannot mean 6 hectares, but that ordinarily the area is the least certain element of a description and the last element to be considered in determining boundaries. In the present instance we cannot deal in exactitudes. There was too much guess work in estimating areas when this title was established. Exact areas were neither required nor possible. Land values were probably less than the cost of a survey, even if a competent surveyor were available. This land has become valuable because it was built up by the Navy and its contractors. The trial court had the advantage over us in that the judge is familiar with prewar conditions and the loose method followed in determining areas. We cannot say that in this case the petitioner is attempting to claim part of the public domain. His claim to ownership has been subjected to the scrutiny of both the Naval government and the present government. We affirm.</p>\n    <p id=\"b146-5\">\n      <em>II. Application of Pedro Atoigue Rojas and Nieves Castro Rojas, Civil No. S8-A.</em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"b146-6\">In Iglesias, supra, we affirmed the lower court, not on the basis of adverse possession, but on the ground that on all the evidence in that particular case the quantity of land involved was properly held to have been included in the original general description. In the instant case we must determine whether applicants may prove fee simple title, again in the circumstances of the particular case, when the original grant was not accepted for recordation. The gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>ernment of Guam did not show that the original grantor was without title, but only that he did not have title of record when he granted the property. Again we must bear in mind the conditions which existed at the time.</p>\n    <p id=\"b147-3\">An instrument dated January 26, 1918 and filed for record on that date purported to convey the property in question here from Mariano Camacho to Pedro Rojas. On February 5, 1918, Pedro Rojas deeded this property and two others to Vicente Diaz Flores as security for a $500 loan. It is noted that this instrument is well drafted and was executed before a judge of the Island Court. This instrument was likewise denied recordation but cautionary notices were made. The instrument was canceled on December 6, 1920, presumably because the $500 was repaid. The government does not question that taxes were paid on the property and that Rojas was in continuous possession of the property until 1944 when it was taken under some informal arrangement by the Navy for a contractor\u2019s camp. The Navy surveyed the land and the United States formalized its possession by a series of duly recorded leases which together cover the period from July 1, 1951 to June 30, 1961, paid rent under these to the applicants, and finally returned possession to the applicants. There is nothing to indicate that the ownership of the land by the applicants was ever questioned by anyone until the petition for registration was filed in 1962. The Navy surveyed the land and surrendered it to the applicants. The Acting Director of Land Management, the department charged with recording instruments and preserving records showing the land holdings of the government of Guam, was asked (Tr. p. 12) whether his records indicated that the government of Guam had any interest in this property. He replied that the government of Guam did not have any interest in the property except for easements and that the property did not adjoin any government property.</p>\n    <p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The appellant has sought to show that a part of the land is included within document 25219 dated February 26, 1952, conveying to the government of Guam all the lands which were transferred to the Secretary of the Interior under Executive Order 10178, 15 F.R. 7313, which is set out in full in 48 U.S.C.A. pages 600-602. The Acting Director of Land Management at one point testified that he believed a portion of the land fell within that conveyed by the above mentioned document, but later expressed doubt about it. It should be noted that that document only covered lands which had been selected by the Secretary of the Navy for transfer or sale pursuant to the Act of November 15, 1945, 59 Stat. 584, to persons in replacement of lands acquired for military or naval purposes in Guam, \u201ca list and description of such lands being on file in the Department of the Navy\u201d. It is not to be presumed on this meager evidence that the United States, through the Navy, was paying rental on this land to the applicants for years if the Secretary of the Navy had already determined that it was government land and had transferred it.</p>\n    <p id=\"b148-5\">There is a tendency, long after the fact, in these cases to ignore or belittle the surveys made by the Navy and the large establishment created by the Navy to examine into titles as a basis for eminent domain proceedings or the payment of just compensation for use. This property was never surveyed until the Navy did it. The original deed to Rojas showed a consideration of $250.00. The amount of land approximates closely the tract upon which taxes were paid. We fully agree that title cannot be acquired against either the United States or the government of Guam by mere adverse possession, but in this case we believe that the applicants have made out a proper case for the presumption of a lost grant and that the United States and the government of Guam, if either of them ever had any beneficial interest in this land, were estopped by their laches from now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>asserting it effectively. It should be further noted that the Guam Land Title Registration Act, lacking one of the essentials of a true Torrens system as noted above, in effect provides merely a system of quieting title which is essentially an equity matter and in which equitable considerations must be considered. For the proposition that laches and estoppel in such matters apply against the government, see <em>People of Porto Rico v. Livingston </em>(1931) 47 F.2d 712, in which the court stated at page 722:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b149-3\">\u201cThe District Court also grounded its equity jurisdiction on laches and estoppel and there is much to sustain its ruling both on the facts and law; .... The equity jurisdiction is clearly established by the answer setting up in substance a cross-bill to quiet title' and remove a cloud and praying for affirmative relief; and in equity, as against the government asserting title, the defense of equitable estoppel and laches, which are very potent on the facts in this case, are, of course, available....\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b149-4\">The situation here is in many ways similar to that in <em>Carino v. Insular Government of the Philippine Islands </em>(1909) 212 U.S. 449, 29 S.Ct. 334, which was a land registration case arising in the Philippine Islands in which the applicant had no paper title but the Supreme Court of the United States held that the land would be presumed to have been held in private ownership and could be registered as such. See also <em>Reavis v. Fianza </em>(1909) 215 U.S. 16, 30 S.Ct. 2; <em>United States v. Fullard-Leo </em>(1946) 156 F.2d 757; and <em>United States v. Fullard-Leo </em>(1947) 331 U.S. 256, 67 S.Ct. 1287, in which the Supreme Court of the United States stated at page 270:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b149-5\">\u201cThe presumption of a lost grant to land has received recognition as an appropriate means to quiet long possession. It recognizes that lapse of time may cure the neglect or failure to secure the proper muniments of title, even though the lost grant may not have been in fact executed. The doctrine first appeared in the field of incorporeal hereditaments but has been extended to realty. The rule applies to claims to land held adversely to the sovereign.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>We affirm on the ground that the government of Guam has not shown that it has title, either in fee or under its control, as against the record made by the applicants establishing a prima facie case of ownership based on the presumption of a lost grant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b150-5\"><em>III. Application of Francisco C. Carbullido and Maria C. </em>Carbullido, <em>Civil No. 41-A.</em></p>\n    <p id=\"b150-7\">In a comprehensive opinion the court below denied the applicants registration in fee simple of Lot No. 444, Municipality of Agat. The court found that petitioners\u2019 predecessor, Jose Q. Chaco, received a deed from Tomas C. Charfauros on March 16, 1926. This deed was denied recordation because it was not shown that Charfauros had title to the property; that Jose Q. Chaco took possession of the land and raised crops thereon; that about 1927 a cadastral survey included this land. Monuments were erected.</p>\n    <p id=\"b150-8\">In holding that the applicants had not shown ownership in fee simple the court pointed out:</p>\n    <p id=\"b150-9\">1. That there was no showing that the land was privately held within the meaning of the Treaty of Paris, 13 Stat. 1754, April 11, 1898; that Crown lands passed to the United States.</p>\n    <p id=\"b150-10\">2. That on February 26, 1952, the Secretary of the Interior, by Document No. 25219, conveyed land, including this land, to the government of Guam; that prior to 1952 title to the land was in the United States of America.</p>\n    <p id=\"b150-11\">3. That as against the title vested in the government of Guam in 1952, Sections 315 and 325 of the Guam Code of Civil Procedure are not applicable and that the deed from the Secretary of the Interior contains a reversionary clause under which this land would revert to the United States if the land were declared to be in fee simple in the applicants.</p>\n    <p id=\"b150-12\">It is unfortunate that the government of Guam has never placed before the courts a complete history of the develop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>ment of taxing and title procedures under the Naval Government of Guam. This defect was remedied in part by the testimony of Judge Bitanga in the present case. Judge Bitanga has appeared as an expert witness for the United States in many condemnation proceedings in the District Court where he impressed all of us with his remarkable memory for ownership, land areas, etc., of land before World War II. His experience in this area began in 1919. He became a land judge and senior board member of the Board of Appraisers. He described the practice of this Board. They were required each three years to appraise real property for tax purposes. The Board notified the village commissioners to have all landowners available to have their lands appraised. They went upon the land, and in the absence of surveys, got the landowners to agree as to their boundaries. He testified that when government land was involved the land judge could set the boundary for government land. He recalled that the land in question here had been surveyed and monuments placed and that it was used as a ranch with a fence on one side. Otherwise, the land was entirely surrounded by government land.</p>\n    <p id=\"b151-3\">We are convinced that the Naval Government of Guam permitted occupancy of Crown land by permit but that under General Order No. 52, March 6, 1903, it never changed its position that it had no authority to concede public land to private persons until the Federal Congress \u201cshall make provision therefor.\u201d The writer of this opinion had occasion to make a study of the annual reports submitted to the Secretary of the Navy by the naval governors. One of the governors established a Torrens system for registering titles which followed the lines of the present Land Title Registration Act. Land which had been approved for registration became the subject of a certificate of guaranteed claim. The original certificate provided that the Naval Government would guarantee the title against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>world but this wording was changed to provide that the Naval Government would defend the title against the world. In his annual report the naval governor stated that he recognized that titles so obtained were not valid as against the United States but that it was assumed that when Congress legislated permanently for Guam, the Congress would recognize the propriety of the action. By 1950 when the Organic Act of Guam was enacted, this was ancient history and nothing was done by the Congress to waive any interest the United States might have in favor of private persons who may have occupied land owned by the United States.</p>\n    <p id=\"b152-4\">As we have previously pointed out, we are not considering in .these cases the right to possession but the question of fee simple title. <em>Sauget v. Villagomez, 228 </em>F.2d 374 (9th Cir., 1955) involved the question as to whether a purchaser of registered land could eject an occupant who had built a house on such land under an alleged oral agreement to purchase the land. The Court of Appeals held, in part:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\u201cOn the evidence the trial court was entitled to find that Villagomez had purchased some property right known to the Spanish civil law formerly applicable to Guam, which corresponds to a common law easement entitling Villagomez to own and occupy a house on the land.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b152-6\">We agree that adverse possession does not run against either the United States or the government of Guam. We are also of the opinion that in this case the evidence is not strong enough to establish either the presumption of a lost grant or an estoppel of the government based on laches. The evidence as to open possession under claim of ownership, as to the exact area involved, and as to acknowledgment by the government of the applicants\u2019 ownership, is not nearly as strong as in the Rojas case. P.L. 1-56, effective January 27, 1960, is a comprehensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Marketable Title Act which validates titles of record held before January 1, 1935, but it is noted, Section 1218.10, Civil Code of Guam that</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b153-3\">\u201cExcept that this Article shall not be deemed to affect the right, title or interest of the United States of America or the territory of ' Guam to any lands in the territory of Guam.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b153-4\">Section 315 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b153-5\">\u201cThe government of Guam will not sue any person for or in respect to any real property, or the issues or profits thereof, by reason of the right or title of the government of Guam to the same, unless:</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b153-6\">1. Such right or title or cause of action shall have accrued within 10 years before any action or other proceeding for the same is commenced; or,</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b153-7\">2. The government of Guam, or those from whom they claim, shall have received the rents and profits of such real property, or of some part thereof, within the space of 10 years; or,</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b153-8\">3. The Governor of Guam by special order shall direct an action to be brought.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b153-9\">This section was taken from California, except for the provision authorizing the Governor to direct that an action shall be brought. This section may give certain possessory rights to the applicant-appellants but in Guam where proprietory rights in government of Guam land do not exist, the right to possession, if it exists, is not fee simple title, <em>People v. Kerber, </em>152 Cal. 731, 93 P. 878 (1908), and <em>Bartholomew v. Staheli, </em>86 C.A.2d 844; 195 P.2d 824:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b153-10\">\u201cMoreover, property owned by the state is held in trust for the people of the state, and may not be lost or abandoned through the negligence of its officers or agents.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b153-11\">In affirming the Island Court we invite the government of Guam to make inquiry as to whether this is not a situation wherein title to this property would not have been good if title had not been in the United States. There may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>be other instances where initial possession and development may have been in contemplation of eventual title in reliance upon the policies of the Naval Government of Guam.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Plaintiff\u2019s accompanying memorandum argued that Defendant had no legal justification for appropriating Plaintiff\u2019s check and since there was no dispute as to facts Defendant\u2019s act was a tort (conversion) as a matter of law.</p>\n    <p id=\"b370-7\">Defendant\u2019s opposition brief states, at page 11:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b370-8\">De Castro nowhere denies his signature on the Continuing Guaranty. Yet the Continuing Guaranty provided the <em>whole basis </em>of the Bank\u2019s action in taking the proceeds of the check. . . . (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b370-9\">Defendant\u2019s position is faulty, however, as Plaintiff points out in his Reply Memorandum, because the Guaranty itself does not justify the action taken by Defendant Bank.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b370-10\">. . . you are hereby authorized to apply against indebtedness of the borrower <em>other than that guaranteed hereby </em>any monies paid or available to you. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b370-11\">DECISION</p>\n    <p id=\"b370-12\">In oral argument before this Court on October 1, 1976, Defendant argued that the above quoted language of the Guaranty was clearly erroneous but if re-read in another way with the instrument as a whole gives a different result. This Court sees no basis for bringing in parol evidence of the intended meaning of the Guaranty instrument particularly where the Defendant Bank drafted the instrument. The language of the instrument is clear on its face and must be strictly construed against the drafting Bank.</p>\n    <p id=\"b370-13\">Defendant\u2019s second argument, that the Bank\u2019s action is justified on the theory of a banker\u2019s lien, is also mistaken. Such liens apply only to customers or depositors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>of the bank, not to payees of a check presented for cashing only. It is admitted by Defendant Bank that payee\u2019s intention was to cash the check, not deposit it. Although Defendant cites numerous cases involving Banker\u2019s liens, none of the cases pertain to the situation at bar where a check is presented by a payee for cashing only. Consequently the Bank exercised possession and control over said check without legal justification, which action was tortious.</p>\n    <p id=\"b371-3\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion for Partial Summary Judgment is hereby granted.</p>\n    <p id=\"b371-4\">Submit order.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

These documents include assertions that \u201cby reason of bias and prejudice of the Honorable Paul J. Abbate, a fair and impartial trial cannot be had before him.\u201d Annexed to these documents are \u201cExhibit A\u2019s, which are copies of indictments of a one Frank Rodney Reyes and a one Gordon Steve Clay charging same with the murders of Gregory Valer Abbate, Jan Marie Faria, and Mary Louise Farrell. Included in the document is the notation that \u201cGregory Valer Abbate is the son of the Honorable Paul J. Abbate.\u201d</p>\n    <p id=\"b295-5\">There was presented no evidence nor was any allegation made that defendants Dally and Landgraf bear any relationship with those defendants whose names appear in the attached indictments. Further, there was presented no evidence nor were any allegations made that I have had any direct or remote relationship with defendants Dally and Landgraf.</p>\n    <p id=\"b295-6\">On first impression, I am at a loss to understand upon what legal theory these requests for disqualification are supported by the annexed exhibits. Therefore, having failed to receive same, I have been compelled to attempt to extrapolate from these disparate elements the legal theory upon which defendants Dally and Landgraf rest their requests, in order that I might intelligently and judiciously respond.</p>\n    <p id=\"b295-7\">Apparently, it is their theory that the experiencing of this personal tragedy by myself has resulted in a warping of my judicial faculties. More specifically, it would appear that defendants Dally and Landgraf are <em>alleging </em>that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>event has heightened my abhorrence to crime to such an extent as to blur my judicial vision, thereby preventing me from viewing them (or, for that matter, any defendants) as other than as a guilty party.</p>\n    <p id=\"b296-3\">After examining the decisional law relative to the issues raised by both the facts presented, and the theory I was forced to impose upon same, I cannot but conclude that this request fails for the most fundamental of reasons. Simply stated, it fails to present any evidence or make any allegation of facts which relate defendants Dally and Landgraf to myself.</p>\n    <p id=\"b296-4\">In 1937, the Supreme Court of California in <em>People v. Swett, </em>65 P.2d 899, while reviewing a petition pursuant to \u00a7 170(4) of the California Code (essentially the same as Guam Code \u00a7 170(4)), enunciated for the first time that an essential element of any claim under this section need be a showing of facts which give rise to a probable inference of bias or prejudice against the <em>specific </em>moving litigant. At page 901 of that decision, the court stated \u201c... furthermore it is well established that before bias or prejudice can disqualify a judge it must be shown to exist against the particular party moving for the substitution of the judge.\u201d It is worth noting that the factual setting of that decision is rather analogous to the present, inasmuch as the bias or prejudice, which was alleged, was claimed to have arisen from the Judge\u2019s prior status as Attorney General. The allegation being that that former status made him biased against all criminal defendants.</p>\n    <p id=\"b296-5\">The principle of law established in <em>Swett </em>has been affirmed on numerous occasions, however, perhaps never as succinctly as <em>In re Osslo, </em>334 P.2d 1, where at page 10 the court opined.</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b296-6\">The degree of bias and prejudice which disqualifies a trial judge is more than a nebulous belief that the judge had some preconceived ideas about a piece of litigation, it is personal bias and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>prejudice or a bent or leaning for or against the litigant, which regardless of the merits of the cause, makes it impossible for the judge to view the case dispassionately.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b297-3\">And as recently as 1974, this substantive issue of law has been upheld by the Oregon Supreme Court in <em>Brauhn v. Brauhn, </em>518 P.2d 1089 where the court states at p. 1093:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b297-4\">It is often held that to disqualify a judge from sitting, it is not enough that the claimed bias be with respect to the subject matter of the law suit; it must be with respect to the person of the party litigant.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b297-5\">With respect to the extrapolated theory that abhorrence to crime may give rise to grounds for disqualification, I would like to address counsel\u2019s attention to the language in <em>Crawford v. Ferguson, </em>115 P.278 at 282 which I look upon favorably as a sound piece of both judicial and social sense.</p>\n    <p id=\"b297-6\">[6] There is a great and manifest difference between prejudice against a crime and being prejudiced against a person who may be charged with the commission of such crime. Every good citizen is prejudiced against the commission of crime. If being prejudiced against the commission of \u00a1crime is a disqualification, then the members of this court are disqualified to decide any case pending before them....</p>\n    <p id=\"b297-7\"> With respect to the authority of <em>In re Murchison, </em>349 U.S. 133 which defense counsel offers as support for his position, I cannot but ironically note that if anything this case supports the overwhelming weight of authority which I believe this decision to be in accord with. Specifically, <em>In re Murchison </em>reasserts rather forcefully the principle that if there are facts which relate the judge with the defendant, which may give rise to bias or prejudice, then a disqualification is required to satisfy the dictates of due process. In this instance, no such facts were submitted or alleged.</p>\n    <p id=\"b297-8\">In addition to examining the legal precedents surrounding this issue, I have as well examined the factual record to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>determine if there perhaps could be found there any substantiation to the theory I was compelled to extrapolate from the documents submitted. In essence, I examined the cases heard before me during the 10 months prior to July 21, 1974; and the cases heard during the 10 months subsequent thereto. Specifically, I examined the verdicts rendered in all those cases. The raw data is as follows:</p>\n    <p id=\"b298-5\">1. # cases heard prior to July 21: 17</p>\n    <p id=\"b298-6\">(a) # guilty verdicts : 7</p>\n    <p id=\"b298-7\">(b) # not guilty verdicts : 10</p>\n    <p id=\"b298-8\">non-conviction rate : 58%</p>\n    <p id=\"b298-9\">2. <em># </em>cases heard subsequent to</p>\n    <p id=\"b298-12\">July 21 15</p>\n    <p id=\"b298-13\">(a) # guilty verdicts 4</p>\n    <p id=\"b298-14\">(b) # not guilty 11</p>\n    <p id=\"AxL\">non-conviction rate 73%</p>\n    <p id=\"b298-10\">From a most cursory analysis of these figures, it is strikingly apparent that: 1.1 have not been critically biased or prejudiced towards all criminal defendants whose trials have been heard before me, inasmuch as 11 of those defendants appearing before me since July 21 have been found not guilty. II. A more careful analysis of these records in fact reveals that the conviction and non-conviction rate of criminal defendants heard before me in the respective time periods are essentially identical. Actually, the non-conviction rate in the subsequent time period is greater than the prior period (prior 58%; subsequent 73%):</p>\n    <p id=\"b298-11\">This empirical analysis perhaps best answers the question of whether I have become irreparably biased or prejudiced against all criminal defendants. The answer inescapably is an emphatic NO!</p>\n    <p id=\"b299-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>I have taken great pains to research and write this decision. I have done so for three reasons. First, because I have received this request in essentially this identical form on numerous occasions. Second, because I wish this to be the definitive opinion on this issue and therefore, dispositive of these numerous requests. And third, because I wish, in addition, to identify myself with that line of cases which have held unanimously that where a judge determines a request of this nature to be \u201cfrivolous\u201d or a \u201csham\u201d it may strike same from the record and disregard it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, the court wishes to allow this opinion to serve as adequate notice that requests of this nature are viewed as frivolous and as shams and I will not address myself to same in the future, but rather, disregard them and have them struck from the record.</p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n      <p id=\"b299-3\"><em> </em>See <em>Neblett v.

The motion was heard ex parte on July 5, 1978, and decision was reserved.</p>\n    <p id=\"b583-10\">It is defendant\u2019s position that the request is authorized by the fair and impartial trial provision of the Sixth Amendment, and by the Due Process clause and Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b583-11\">The Court will first consider whether the allocation of funds to an indigent defendant for the purpose of conducting a public opinion poll is necessary to determine whether a fair trial can be held. Defendant is represented by court-appointed counsel, the public defender being disqualified due to a conflict of interest. In a factually similar case, the Supreme Court of Idaho affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s request to conduct a community survey. The Court stated:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b583-12\">. . . Financial assistance is not automatically mandatory, but rather depends upon needs of the defendant as revealed by the facts and circumstances of each case. Before authorizing the expenditure of public funds for a particular purpose in an indigent\u2019s defense, the trial court must determine whether the funds are necessary in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>interest of justice. . . . Appellant loses sight of the viable alternatives available to a defendant in a criminal prosecution which can evaluate the sentiment in a community without resorting to the public coffers. A defendant has the opportunity to present to the trial court all the material disseminated to the public which he feels instills in their minds such prejudice against him as to prevent an impartial trial. He also has the opportunity to thoroughly examine each juror upon voir dire to ferret out bias and prejudice. We do not believe that a public survey could appreciably improve on the process as it now exists. <em>State v. Powers, </em>537 P.2d 1369, 1374 (1975).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b584-5\">The Court finds this reasoning sound. Defendant on voir dire can thoroughly examine each prospective juror. Additionally, he can present to the Court the material disseminated to the public which in his opinion denies him an impartial trial.</p>\n    <p id=\"b584-6\">Defendant\u2019s next contention is that the Due Process clause requires funds to be allocated for a public opinion poll. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Mason v. Arizona, </em>504 F.2d 1345 (9th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 936, 95 S.Ct. 1145 (1975), addressed the issue of whether the Due Process clause entitles an indigent defendant to investigative expenses. The Court stated:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b584-7\">. . . the effective assistance of counsel guarantee of the Due Process Clause requires, when necessary, the allowance of investigative expenses or appointment of investigative assistance for indigent defendants in order to insure effective preparation of their defense by their attorneys. <em>Mason v. Arizona, </em>504 F.2d at 1351.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b584-8\">However, the Court then limited its holding by specifying that the right was not mandatory, but rather depends upon the facts of the particular case.</p>\n    <p id=\"b584-9\">. . . Our holding denotes, however, that such assistance is not automatically mandatory but rather depends upon the need as revealed by the facts and circumstances of each case. <em>Mason v. Arizona, </em>504 F.2d at 1352.</p>\n    <p id=\"b585-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Similarly, the Supreme Court of Indiana established basically the same criteria in <em>Magley v. State of Indiana, </em>335 N.E.2d 811, 816 (1975).</p>\n    <p id=\"b585-3\">. . . But, when the court is allocating state funds for the defense of a defendant, it is rational for the court to use discretion in granting or denying the defendant\u2019s requests . . . Within the primary goal of the judicial process, which is due process of law for each defendant, the court may determine which expenses are probably needless, wasteful or extravagant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b585-4\">Pursuant to the guidelines set forth by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Mason, </em>the Court has examined the facts and circumstances of the case. Defendant has among other procedural safeguards that of presenting the news material to the Court, questioning the prospective jurors on voir dire, challenging the jurors for cause, and exercising his peremptory challenges. The Court finds that the allocation of funds for an opinion poll is not necessitated by the Due Process clause.</p>\n    <p id=\"b585-5\">Thirdly, there is defendant\u2019s equal protection argument. Defendant has failed to demonstrate that he has been treated differently from' other indigent defendants similarly situated. As the Court in <em>State v. Powers, </em>537 P.2d at 1374, enunciated:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b585-6\">. . . Appellant has not demonstrated that he has been treated differently from other indigent defendants similarly situated. ... It is fundamentally fair to require a showing by the indigent, represented by private court appointed counsel, that there is a necessity for allowance to employ investigators. The trial court\u2019s failure to appoint an investigator whom it deemed unnecessary to conduct a community survey to aid appellant\u2019s court appointed private counsel, did not violate the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b585-7\">Defendant has not adequately demonstrated to the Court that an opinion poll is necessary. The Court finds no violation of the Equal Protection clause.</p>\n    <p id=\"b586-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>For the aforementioned reasons, the Court denies defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n    <p id=\"b586-3\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Following the verdict a judgment was entered awarding plaintiff, Richard H. Cleveland, One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) damages with interest against defendants, Peter Imaizumi, Pedro Imaizumi and Antonia Imaizumi, only. The jury awarded plaintiff, Thomas Baty, Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) with interest from defendants, Charles Arceo, Jose Arceo and Antonia L. G. Arceo, only, and under the counterclaim awarded counterclaimant, Charles Arceo, Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) with interest from Thomas Baty; and judgment was entered thereon.</p>\n    <p id=\"b439-6\">Both in their brief and in oral argument plaintiffs asserted that they did not and do not seek a new trial against defendants or either or any of them, and were content to have the judgment heretofore entered be final against those respective defendants. For that reason we need to consider this appeal only as it applies to the recovery under the counterclaim.</p>\n    <p id=\"b439-7\">The only serious question which is presented has to do with the contention that counsel for the defendants, Arceo, so misconducted himself as to require us to reverse the judgment under the counterclaim, and we conclude that we must do so.</p>\n    <p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>During the trial, counsel for defendants, Arceo, deliberately interjected questions of race, employment, the fact that plaintiffs were members of a union, the arrangements they had made with their counsel as to the latter\u2019s compensation, and even went so far as to bring before the jury, by inference, a question of homosexuality on the part of the plaintiffs. This conduct was reprehensible and it fell far below the standard to be expected of any officer of the court and so contaminated the entire jury as to require reversal.</p>\n    <p id=\"b440-5\">During the course of the trial the judge presiding did admonish the jury concerning the misconduct of defense counsel, but it is clear to us that no admonishment could have corrected the situation which had occurred, for the jury had been prejudiced to such an extent that no corrective action by the trial judge could have undone the damage caused by counsel.</p>\n    <p id=\"b440-6\">Appeals to matters of race, union affiliation, and the financial arrangements made between attorney and client have nothing to do with the merits of the case. They serve only to confuse and to prejudice. <em>Calloway v. Fogel, </em>213 S.W.2d 405 (Mo.)</p>\n    <p id=\"b440-7\">The reckless assertions made by defense counsel were unsupported by the proof and clearly were intended to arouse prejudices against the litigants, and we condemn that as tending to cause a miscarriage of justice. Such conduct cannot be excused or condoned. <em>Missouri K-TR Co. of Texas v. Ridgeway, </em>191 F.2d 363 (CA8).</p>\n    <p id=\"b440-8\">There was no evidence whatsoever that any party to the action was a homosexual, and this matter having come-before the jury, even by inference, served only to further' contaminate the jury and to deprive plaintiffs of their right, to a fair trial. Such references alone would be clearly sufficient to necessitate a reversal. <em>Colfer v. Vale, </em>363 P.2d 588 (Ariz.).</p>\n    <p id=\"b441-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>In view of the foregoing, the judgment on the verdict in the main action is affirmed, and the judgment entered on the verdict as to the counterclaim only is reversed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Therefore, exceptions to Section 12315, whether couched in negative or positive language, must exist. Without implementing regulations promulgated, under Section 12321 in accordance with procedure set forth in Section 12007, to give active meaning to said Section 12315, Defendant\u2019s 6th Amendment right is violated by being charged thereunder.</p>\n    <p id=\"b383-3\">Had regulations been promulgated the Prosecution would be under an obligation to: (1) give the official citation of the rule which Defendant allegedly violated; (2) state the specific nature of the alleged crime; (3) plead to nonexistence of facts giving rise to any exception which nullify the illegality of Defendant\u2019s acts. But where no regulations have been promulgated, Section 12315 alone cannot be used to criminally accuse Defendant because Defendant does not know with clarity what wrongful act he is accused of doing.</p>\n    <p id=\"b383-4\">It is not Defendant\u2019s obligation to research the existence or nonexistence of a regulation which might apply. Yet an information lacking specificity negates the Defendant\u2019s ability to prepare a defense. The government is obligated to provide an accused with a \u201c. . . plain, concise and definite written statement of the essential facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>constituting the offense charged\u201d. (Rule 7(c)). The Prosecution has not carried its burden as count one of this information does not comply with the law.</p>\n    <p id=\"b384-5\">Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss count one is hereby granted.</p>\n    <p id=\"b384-6\">Submit order.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Agana Bay Development Company (Hong Kong), Ltd., </em>(Sup. Ct. Guam, c.c., No. 159-74, 1974). The court noted that the authorities upon which that court rested its decision were primarily the cases of <em>Gunther v. Merchant\u2019s Warren National Bank, </em>360 F.Supp. 1085 (D. Me. 1973); <em>Bank of Hawaii v. Emerson, </em>District Court of Guam, Case 99-72 (1973); and <em>Flaherty Electric Co. v. Modular Structures Inc., </em>District Court of Guam, Case 204-72 (1973). However, the court also noted that these decisions were constitutionally framed in the context of attachment statutes (Maine\u2019s &amp; Guam\u2019s). In those instances the essential legal question before the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>was whether the absolute prohibitions against alienation of real property inherent in their respective attachment statutes constitute a sufficient \u201ctaking\u201d as to bring this question within the purview of the U.S. Supreme Court decisions of 1) <em>Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67 (1972) and 2) <em>Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., </em>395 U.S. 337 (1969), thereby requiring that the full panoply of procedural due process protections become applicable. All of these decisions ruled that these absolute alienation statutes did constitute such \u201ctakings\u201d. An example of such a statute would be that of Guam\u2019s Civil Procedure Code Sections 537-61. Section 548 indicates the absoluteness of the restriction on alienation which attachment engenders. This section prohibits the sale or transfer of any interest in the real estate in question except under the supervision of the court and, further, any proceeds obtained thereby must be deposited with same.</p>\n    <p id=\"b304-3\">It must be noted that at the time that <em>Dillingham </em>was decided, the above authorities were all that were available for consideration. However, subsequent to that decision, two Federal District Courts and one state supreme court have examined the precise issue of the constitutionality of mechanic liens. The primary focus of these decisions has been that of analyzing the degree of \u201ctaking\u201d involved in a mechanics lien statute and a determination of whether such is sufficient to warrant the application of the 14th Amendment\u2019s procedural due process protections. The Federal District Court decision in <em>Cook v. Carlson, </em>364 F.Supp. 24 (D.S.D. 1973) analyzed the South Dakota mechanics lien statute. The Arizona mechanics lien statute was evaluated in <em>Spielman-Ford v. Hanson Inc., </em>379 F.Supp. 997 (D. Arizona 1974); and the California mechanics lien statute was analyzed by that Supreme Court in <em>Connolly Development Inc. v. Superior Court, </em>41 C.A.3d 543 (1974). All of these courts uniformly held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>relative limitation on the alienation of realty via the application of their respective mechanics lien statutes is \u201cde minimis\u201d inasmuch as it does not prevent the alienation of realty but merely makes same more onerous. An examination of the Guam statute reveals it to be of this nature inasmuch as its effect is to merely make the lienor\u2019s claim superior to any subsequent interest taken in the property to which it applies. Therefore, any subsequent purchasers of that realty would merely take same subject to the payment of the outstanding lien. Therefore, it may be concluded that the Guam mechanics lien statute constitutes such a de minimis taking of property as not to fall within the 14th Amendment\u2019s definition of \u201ctaking\u201d and therefore is not constitutionally defective.</p>\n    <p id=\"b305-3\">Submit order.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

See <em>Kelly v. Williams, </em>346 S.W.2d 434 (Texas 1961), <em>General Insurance Company v. Faulkner, </em>130 S.E.2d 645 (N.C. 1963), <em>Mahaney v.

In essence the legislature, in enacting Section 1716, is exercising its police powers in an attempt to limit or retard the growth of Juvenile Delinquency by compelling parents to exercise greater or more effective control on the actions of their children. The question then becomes whether the legislature was acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>with respect to an appropriate public matter to which their police powers may be applied; and whether the means utilized to effect this public matter bears a reasonable relationship to such to effect the desired result.

Edge, insured by Capital, left her car with motor running and without set<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>ting the brakes. The car either went into gear or otherwise was set in motion and struck a building, damaging it in the amount of $1,160.00. There is no serious question as .to the negligence or damage.

It can be assumed that she left Guam shortly after the accident and that her present whereabouts are unknown to Capital.</p>\n    <p id=\"b179-3\">The trial court was of the view that opinions of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit have construed Guam legislation to mean that the injured person cannot recover from an insurance company if the company has a defense against the insured under the policy for failure of the insured to comply with conditions subsequent in .the policy.

To sustain the trial court we would be required to hold that neither the Direct Action Statute nor the Financial Eesponsibility Law of Guam gives the injured person any rights against an insurance company if the insured has failed to comply with policy conditions after the accident which require notification, availability to assist, either or both. The trial court was of the view that this conclusion was required by <em>Sumait v. Capital Fire and Casualty Company, </em>296 F.2d 108 (9th Cir. 1961), and <em>Capital Insurance and Surety Company, Inc. v. Kelly, </em>361 F.2d 567 (9th Cir. 1966).</p>\n    <p id=\"b179-5\">In <em>Sumait </em>the court simply held that an injured plaintiff under the terms of the policy in effect at the time of the accident could not recover against the company without bringing himself within the terms of the policy. Condition 7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>of the policy provided that recovery could not be had against the company until the liability of the insured had been determined by judgment or agreement. The Direct Action Statute was not in effect at the time of the accident. <em>Kelly </em>involved a case in which the insured was killed in the accident. The appellate court reversed the holding of the district court that the action did not abate against the insurance company even if it abated against the deceased tortfeasor. But Judge Ely, in <em>Kelly, </em>made it clear that the opinion went no further than to hold that under Guam law a defense available to the insured was available to the company, that if by death no action existed against the insured there could be no liability on the part of the company. This situation has now been corrected in Guam by permitting survival of actions. Judge Ely said, p. 569</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b180-5\">There was a strongly valid reason for Guam\u2019s action in authorizing a direct proceeding against the insurer of an automobile operating upon Guam\u2019s roadways. It is well known that the population of the Territory, military personnel and others, has been unusually transient in its nature. Obviously, it was believed that an insurer of an automobile should not escape a just obligation because of the removal of its insured from the Territory and the consequent difficulty or impossibility of subjecting the insured himself to the jurisdiction, in personam, of the courts of Guam. It is hardly to be questioned, however, that the legislature contemplated that an insurer, sued in a direct action, might encounter no insurmountable obstacle in presenting its insured\u2019s testimony, either in deposition form or by production of the witness personally.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b180-6\">In analyzing the case at hand, different considerations of policy are apparent. An alleged tortfeasor who is deceased may have been the only witness to events which might fairly exculpate him from legal responsibility. The rule that a tort action against him abates with his death was predicated upon the belief that public policy would be best served by avoiding the possibility that heirs suffer injustice because death foreclosed the opportunity for successful defense.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b180-7\">In this case, we cannot undertake to weigh conflicting considerations of public policy. We are not properly empowered to supply additions to an insurance contract, and we cannot enlarge statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>provisions and extend them beyond the limit of such legislative objectives as may reasonably be inferred from the provisions themselves.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b181-3\">Section 43354 of the Government Code of Guam provides for direct action against the insurer which may be brought against the insurer alone or against both the insured and insurer \u201cwithin the terms and limits of the policy.\u201d It can be assumed that this statute, standing alone, simply places the injured person in the shoes of the insured as regards the liability of the insurer. The cause of action against the insurer exists at once. If at the time of the accident the insurer has a valid defense against its insured that defense is valid against the injured plaintiff within the terms and limits of the policy. The opinion in Kelly infers that it is the responsibility of the insurer to obtain the testimony of its insured when and if the insured has left the jurisdiction. The court opinions on the question of breach of conditions subsequent in the policy have been the subject of much dispute. 7 Am.Jur.2d, p. 574, Sec. 225, states the general rule to be that such breach by the insured is a defense against the injured but, at p. 576</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b181-4\">The general rule stated above is not followed in all jurisdictions, however. In a few, a different rule is applied, which may be attributable to the nature of the statutes in such jurisdictions. Thus, it has been held that where the public policy, expressed by the legislature through various statutes, is to protect the interests of injured third persons with respect to enforcing their claims against an automobile liability insurance carrier, the insurer is not relieved of liability where the interest of an injured third party intervenes before an insured\u2019s breach of a liability policy condition, unless the breach is material. Also, some courts take the view that the failure of the insured to give notice of an accident and of the pendency of an action against him by the injured person as provided for by the insurance policy does not prevent such injured person from bringing an action against the insurer.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b181-5\">\u00a7 226. \u2014Policies issued pursuant to compulsory insurance or financial responsibility statutes.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>In the case of automobile liability policies issued pursuant to and in compliance with compulsory insurance or financial responsibility statutes, the rule followed generally, for the reason that such statutes are for the benefit of members of the public and not of the insured, is that the injured person is not subject to defenses arising out of the breach of conditions subsequent to the action even though they would be available to the insurer as against the insured. Thus, failure to give notice of the accident does not constitute a defense to an action by an injured party to recover from the insurer, and this principle has also been applied or recognized in a number of cases where the statutory compulsion related only to taxicab or passenger bus owners, or other motor carriers, or to those engaged in the car rental business.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b182-5\">Also, in accordance with the general rule, lack of cooperation on the part of the insured has been held not to constitute a defense to an action by an injured member of the public to recover from the insurer. Furthermore, a statute may specifically provide that lack of cooperation by the insured shall not operate to defeat the right of recovery from the insurer by the injured person, and such a provision has been held valid. However, where the particular accident or injured person was not within the intended coverage of the compulsory insurance statute, lack of cooperation on the part of the insured has been held to be available as a defense to the compulsory insurer.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b182-6\">The Direct Action Statute is part of the Insurance Code of Guam but the Financial Responsibility Law of Guam is part of the Motor Vehicle Code and its provisions are clearly intended for the protection of third persons. This law, Section 23525, et seq., of the Government Code requires the person who has driven a motor vehicle involved in an accident to report it to the Department of Finance. The report is confidential except as to certain information including insurance. If the driver has insurance in the prescribed amounts he is exempted from posting security as a condition precedent to his continued driving. Such insurance must be in a company authorized to write insurance in Guam and upon receipt of the notice of the accident from the Department the insurer must report as to whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>policy was in effect at the time of the accident. The failure to report the accident by the driver is a misdemeanor.</p>\n    <p id=\"b183-3\">This comprehensive scheme, short of compulsory insurance, falls down when the driver fails to report the accident. In the case before us it is not questioned that the insurance was in existence and that if the insured had reported the accident as required the insurer, upon inquiry, would have reported coverage. The system becomes meaningless if, after reporting coverage, the insurer could rely on lack of notice or failure to cooperate as a defense against the injured third party. The existence of insurance protects the driver against having his license to drive suspended. In these circumstances is the insurer prejudiced by the failure of the insured to report the accident either to the insurer or the government? As the Court pointed out in Kelly, the insurer can obtain the testimony of the insured for any defense on the merits. The injured person, on the contrary, for whose benefit the law exists, has no local recourse against the insured who has left the jurisdiction. The insurer can choose its insurance risks but the victim cannot choose by whom he would be injured. In <em>Royal Indemnity Co. v. Olmstead, </em>193 F.2d 451 (9th Cir. 1951), the court pointed out that as a general rule, unless a policy could be construed as creating an independent right of action in the injured person, his right to recover is subject to any defenses the company might have against the insured. But that an exception exists where the insurance policy was issued to satisfy the requirements of a statute having as its purpose the protection of the public. Olmstead involved compulsory insurance and the court held that the defense of lack of notice or other technical defenses \u201cunder the policy relating to conditions wholly outside the ability of the injured person to secure performance of\u201d were not available to the insurer. The general law appears to support this view as to financial responsibility laws as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>compulsory insurance laws, 7 Am.Jur.2d p. 576, Sec. 226, supra.</p>\n    <p id=\"b184-5\">Assuming that the policy involved here was issued pursuant to the Guam Financial Responsibility Law we must determine whether defenses of lack of notice or failure to cooperate are available to the insurer. In a Guam case it was stated <em>Gumataotao v. Government of Guam, </em>322 F.2d 580 (9th Cir. 1963)</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b184-6\">It is well settled that, in recognition of the fact that local needs, customs and legal systems may differ from those with which we are more familiar, decisions of local courts of United States territories on matters of purely local law will not be reversed unless clear and manifest error is shown. <em>De Castro v. Board of Com\u2019rs of San Juan, </em>322 U.S. 451 (1944); <em>Bonet v. Texas Co. (P.R.), Inc., </em>308 U.S. 463 (1940); <em>Advertiser Publishing Company v. Fase, </em>279 F.2d 636 (9 Cir. 1960); <em>Lord v. Territory of Hawaii, </em>79 F.2d 761 (9 Cir. 1935). In the <em>Bonet </em>case the Supreme Court at page 471 states, \u201c[T]o justify reversal in such cases, the error must be clear or manifest; the interpretation must be inescapably wrong; the decision must be patently erroneous.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b184-7\">There is another factor in Guam, possibly a controlling factor. This was not discussed in the briefs or in oral argument but in practice there is de facto compulsory insurance in Guam which involves a high percentage if not most of the private automobiles. Guam has many military installations and many closed military bases (bases with guarded entrances). The uniform requirement by military commands is that no private vehicle, whether owned by a civilian or a member of the armed services, may enter the base without a showing of the minimum insurance coverage provided for by the Guam Financial Responsibility Law. This is absolute as regards those who are issued decals to be placed on the windshield but may be modified for a visitor. When it is considered that commercial planes land on the closed base of the Naval Air Station and that there are few local car owners who do not have occasion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>enter such bases at some time during the year, the practical necessity for insurance becomes apparent. Those who live on base must have insurance; those who live off base but are employed on base, including large numbers of Guamanians, must have insurance; others, such as the writer of this opinion, who go on base for social or business reasons at regular intervals must demonstrate the existence of insurance before being given a windshield permit good for a year.</p>\n    <p id=\"b185-3\">Reversed and remanded to the Island Court for entry of judgment for the appellants, against Capital, Capital to pay all costs.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The appellant contends that such conviction is contrary to the law and the evidence. Sec. 315 provides:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b412-12\">Every person who keeps a house of ill fame in Guam, resorted to for the purpose of prostitution or lewdness, or who willfully resides in such house, is guilty of a misdemeanor; and in all prosecutions for keeping or resorting to such a house, common repute may be received as competent evidence of the character of the house, the purpose for which it is kept or used, and the character of the women inhabiting or resorting to it.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b412-13\">The evidence which the trial court was entitled to believe was to the effect that the appellant was the owner-proprietress of a bar and restaurant in Guam; that the bar and restaurant were located on the ground floor of a two-story building and the appellant\u2019s living quarters were located on the second floor; that the second floor was reached by a stairway on the outside of the building. As a result of information which reached the Guam Police, alleging that the appellant was prostituting herself, the police watched the building and on several occasions saw the appellant take men to her quarters, that the light in her bedroom was turned out and after a period of time was turned on again, that the men then departed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b412-14\">The government of Guam employed a police informer who testified' that he went to the restaurant and bar on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>December 10, 1955, to drink beer, that he engaged the bartender in conversation and that the bartender informed him that the appellant and two waitresses were available for prostitution; that the bartender directed the appellant to sit with him and that the appellant offered herself for sale; that the witness told her he had no money at that time and left; that he returned on December 13th, paid the appellant, and had sexual relations with her. The witness apparently helped paint the building and made himself useful around the premises.</p>\n    <p id=\"b413-3\">On December 21st he went to the place early in the morning and arranged with the appellant to meet her that evening when he had raised some money. He reported to the police and was given $25.00 and told to keep the engagement. That evening he met the appellant and after paying the appellant the $25.00 prepared ostensibly to have relations with her in the bedroom. While they were in a compromising position he called for police help. The police entered, found the witness and the appellant in the compromising position, and found the $25.00 which the appellant had placed under her removed slacks on an adjacent bed. The appellant in a written statement to the police admitted the events but contended that the witness was her \u201cboy friend\u201d and the money was given to her as a Christmas present.</p>\n    <p id=\"b413-4\">It is unnecessary further to detail the Government\u2019s evidence. The appellant introduced a number of witnesses who testified that the appellant was so friendly that men felt free to visit her living quarters at all hours, but not for immoral purposes.</p>\n    <p id=\"b413-5\">Sec. 315 of the Penal Code of Guam was adopted from the California Penal Code and may be construed in the light of California appellate decisions in existence at the time the Guam Codes were adopted in 1933. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>States v.

The bus was operated by Daniel Tenorio, an employee of the Government. The mission of the bus driver was to return the children to their homes after school. The driver knew Esther and was aware that she was a handicapped child, a deaf-mute since birth.</p>\n    <p id=\"b344-8\">The school bell rang indicating the end of a school day, and Esther boarded the bus for transportation to her abode. Tenorio, the operator, while en route to accomplish his task stopped the school bus in the inside eastbound lane of traffic directly across from Royal Lanes, a bowling alley in Tamuning. He then activated the red flashing light, opened the door and permitted Esther to alight from the bus by herself. At this point Esther, to get to her home, would have to cross the outside eastbound lane of traffic, cross in front of the bus, and then cross two westbound lanes. Esther attempted this dangerous voyage unaccompanied, no guide, no escort and no one to give this assistance. Then an unfortunate occurrence took place. As she crossed the inside westbound lane, Esther was struck and seriously injured by a 1973 Toyota vehicle which was operated by one Eladio B. Nucum and owned by Nation Builders. Esther remained in a coma for several days, sustained a brain injury. She sustained a hemi-paresis of the right side which has diminished to a certain degree, but the residual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>effects are manifested by weakness of the right side and a noticeable limp in her walk.</p>\n    <p id=\"b345-3\">A claim was presented on behalf of the minor child by her mother and natural guardian Maria T. Fejerang under the Government Claims Act, Section 6500 of the Government Code of Guam. The claim was denied in its entirety and the guardian has commenced this action for personal injuries.</p>\n    <p id=\"b345-4\">It is undisputed as to the liability of Nucum and Nation Builders and therefore this action was based upon the negligence of the Government and its employee, the operator of the said school bus. The issue before this Court is whether the intervening negligence of Nucum can be said to relieve from liability the defendants from the consequence of their acts.</p>\n    <p id=\"b345-5\">In resolving the aforementioned issue, the Court is aided by the familiar principle of tort liability that an intervening act by a third person, even if negligent, relieves the original negligent actor from liability only if subsequent wrongdoer\u2019s act could not have been anticipated by the first actor in the exercise of due care. <em>Hall v. E. I. duPont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., </em>345 F.Supp. 353 (E.D.N.Y. 1972).</p>\n    <p id=\"b345-6\">The Court notes that in at least one previous case, it has been held that recovery can be had against the driver of a school bus and his employer when a child alighted from the bus, crossed in front of it and was struck by a vehicle which passed the bus without stopping in violation of a statute. <em>McDonald v. Central School Dist., </em>179 Misc. 333, 39 N.Y.S.2d 103, affd. 264 App. Div. 943. There is no doubt in the Court\u2019s mind that the defendants Tenorio and the Government can be held liable as independent tortfeasors foreseeing a possible statutory violation occurring. (Failure to observe and stop at flashing red lights of school bus.) At this juncture, the Court can now consider whether the defendant Tenorio was negligent for discharging the minor Esther, a deaf-mute, from his bus under all the circumstances.</p>\n    <p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Case law reveals to this Court that there is an apparent consensus of authority that while public school entities are under no obligation to furnish transportation to students in the first instance, if they elect to do so, they will be held to a high degree of care. Therefore, if a school bus driver allows a student to alight from his bus having knowledge that the student may be placed in substantial jeopardy, liability attaches. There are some cases that have reached this result by requiring school bus drivers the same very high degree of care which is required of common carriers. <em>Norris v. American Casualty Co., </em>176 So.2d 677; <em>Webb v. Seattle, </em>22 Wash.2d 596. Other cases hold that while a school system is not a common carrier, it does owe a degree of reasonable and ordinary care to passengers and students and is required to exercise special care in proportion to the age in question and their ability to care for themselves. <em>Hawkins County v. Davis, </em>216 Tenn. 262. The Court finds the latter rationale is more persuasive than the former. See also <em>Shannon v. Central Gaither Union School Dist., </em>133 Ca.App.124; <em>County School Board v. Thomas, </em>201 Va. 608; <em>Machenheimer v. Falknor, </em>144 Wash. 27; <em>Gazaway v. Nicholson, </em>61 Ga. App. 3; <em>Taylor v. Patterson\u2019s Administrator, </em>272 Ky. 415 and <em>Capital Transit Co. v. Burris, </em>276 S.W.2d 56.</p>\n    <p id=\"b346-5\">In this case, the evidence is undisputed. All the parties to this action factually agree. The Court cannot escape the conclusion that defendant Tenorio, in the course of his employment, had a duty to anticipate that someone in the position of Nucum might fail to stop in response to the flashing red light that appeared on the bus, and strike and injure the child. The defendant Tenorio was negligent and his negligence was the proximate cause of the injuries sustained by Esther.</p>\n    <p id=\"b346-6\">In reaching such a decision, this Court realizes the burden imposed on defendant Tenorio by the election of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>superiors to permit this very seriously handicapped child to travel in a school bus of standard size in the company of children not handicapped. A better practice would be to render a specialized service for the transportation of handicapped children, and with direct assistance. This they deserve. This Court can only deplore the evident indifference of the defendant Government to the needs of this and other vulnerable children in this community. It is hoped that in the future more adequate provisions will be made for the transportation of our handicapped so that an unfortunate occurrence such as this will not come before our courts.</p>\n    <p id=\"b347-3\">Judgment for the plaintiff Esther Fejerang in the sum of $30,000; and for medical services rendered and future medical care, the sum of $7,500 together with costs and interest.</p>\n    <p id=\"b347-4\">Submit order.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Upon consulting a lawyer a notice of rescission dated 20 August, 1968, was delivered to Atkins, Kroll.</p>\n    <p id=\"b201-9\">On the 2nd ground, the lower court apparently concluded that Quitugua did not receive any additional benefit in the use of Atkins, Kroll vehicle that he would not have received had he not entered into subject sale and traded in his old vehicle as part of the down payment;</p>\n    <p id=\"b201-10\">On the 3rd ground, you have the positive and clear testimony of a witness that he was not given any written warranty as against another testimony which is not as positive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Obviously ,the lower court chose to believe the positive testimony rather than the other.</p>\n    <p id=\"b202-5\">On the first two grounds, this court must follow the elementary rule on appeal which says that an appellate court may not disturb lower court findings of fact unless it is not supported by preponderance of evidence. In this case the preponderance of evidence sustains the findings of the court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b202-6\">There is no doubt that Quitugua did everything he could possibly do to retain the vehicle until his patience ran out and when his patience did run out, he went to see a lawyer who immediately advised rescission.</p>\n    <p id=\"b202-7\">The court in the case of <em>Williams v. Marshall, </em>37 Cal.2d 445, 235 P.2d 372, 378 (1951), said:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b202-8\">\u201cThe courts have frequently declared that there is no artificial rule as to the laspe of time which will justify the application of the doctrine of laches. Each case must be determined upon the basis of its facts, and in the absence of a palpable abuse of discretion the trial court\u2019s finding upon the issue will not be disturbed upon appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b202-9\">This court concludes that the lower court was correct in finding that the rescission was timely and effective; that the lower court\u2019s decision in not granting Atkins, Kroll any offset and in excluding the express warranty from evidence justified.</p>\n    <p id=\"b202-10\">The judgment of the Island Court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

He appeals and assigns as error the failure of the Island Court to expedite his trial, the failure of the Island Court to suppress evidence in advance of trial, and the use of evidence by the government of Guam which was illegally obtained. There is no merit in any of these contentions and we affirm.</p>\n    <p id=\"b418-17\">The appellant was driving an automobile about midnight when he was stopped by members of the Armed Forces police. In his brief he states that he was asked to show his driver\u2019s license, which he produced, and thereafter proceeded toward his quarters. The Government contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>the appellant represented to members of the Armed Forces police that he was a member of the Guam Legislature. The Armed Forces police contacted Guam police by radio and met with Guam police officers. While the two groups of officers were conferring the appellant drove by and was pointed out to the Guam police. The Guam police then proceeded to follow him for a considerable distance until his erratic driving caused them to stop him, take him into custody and escort him to a doctor at the Guam Memorial Hospital. The doctor at Guam Memorial Hospital gave the appellant a sobriety test, which he flunked.</p>\n    <p id=\"b419-3\">On appeal the appellant does not contend that he was not driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, but does contend that he was not given a fair trial. He contends that he first requested the Island Court to expedite the trial so that he could produce a favorable witness who was about to leave the island. The Island Court was under no obligation to accommodate its trial docket to the demand of the appellant. If the testimony was important, the appellant could have preserved it by deposition. The second complaint is that a motion to suppress evidence before trial was not granted. It is not clear as to what evidence was to have been suppressed. In any event, it was discretionary with the trial court as to whether it would conduct a pre-trial hearing on the motion, or whether it would take the matter up at the time of trial. The third contention is that, having been arrested by the Armed Forces police, if such arrest was illegal, any evidence subsequently obtained by the Guam police was tainted by the initial illegality. The short answer to this allegation is that the appellant was not arrested by the Armed Forces police, according to his own statement. He was stopped, required to produce his driver\u2019s license, and then permitted to proceed. The appellant cites a number of cases which we read<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>ily accept which hold that after an illegal arrest, any evidence obtained by search and seizure may not be admitted. While it is true that except for the report made by the Armed Forces police the Guam police may not have been available to detect the driving, it is equally clear that the arrest by the Guam police was the result of their independent observations. Obviously, if the Armed Forces police had made an arrest, they would have detained the appellant until the Guam police arrived. They did not do so. The Guam police followed the appellant for a considerable distance until they were convinced by his erratic driving that he was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The territory of Guam was represented by David Williams and defendant was represented by Howard Trapp. The motion was heard before the Honorable Richard H.

Section 1.27 was adopted from the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 47.

The Superior Court of Guam in <em>People v. Benavente, </em>1 Guam R. 525 (1978), and <em>People v.

The two petitions seek to register the exact same land. The land in question consists of six lots in the Municipality of Merizo. Title to the six lots is held in the heirs of Felix Barcinas Candaso. On April 20, 1956, a Decree of Final Distribution was entered in Probate Matter No. 625-47, in which the lots in question were distributed to the heirs of Felix Barcinas Candaso in undivided interests.</p>\n    <p id=\"b453-13\">Case No. 76-72 involves a petition by Francisco Candaso Chargualaf and other heirs of Felix Barcinas Candaso to register the six lots in the name of H.O. Felix Barcinas Candaso. Case No. 3-73 involves a counter petition by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Joaquin C. Lujan and his brothers and sisters, who are all grandchildren and heirs of Felix Barcinas Candaso but base their right to register the land in question on the basis of adverse possession.</p>\n    <p id=\"b454-5\">On June 26, 1974, Judge Joaquin Perez entered a Decree Establishing Title to the H.O. of Felix B. Candaso, thus granting the petition in Case No. 76-72 and denying the petition in Case No. 3-73.</p>\n    <p id=\"b454-6\">On July 15, 1974, the appellants filed a motion with the trial court for an extension of time in which to file their notice of appeal. The motion for an extension was granted by Judge Perez apparently ex parte on July 15, 1974. On July 16, 1974, appellants filed their notice of appeal.</p>\n    <p id=\"b454-7\">APPEAL SHOULD BE DISMISSED</p>\n    <p id=\"b454-8\">Rule 2(a) of the Rules of the Appellate Division of the District Court of Guam provides, \u201cWhen an appeal is permitted by law from the Island Court to the District Court, the time within which a Notice of Appeal may be filed shall be fifteen (15) days from the entry of the judgment appealed from,... .\u201d The decree establishing title in Case No. 76-72 was signed by Judge Perez on June 26, 1974, and entered on the same day. The time in which to file a notice of appeal ran out on July 11, 1974. The notice of appeal was filed on July 16, 1974, after Judge Perez granted appellants\u2019 motion of July 15, 1974, to extend the time in which to file a notice of appeal. Appellants\u2019 counsel stated by affidavit that he was never served with a copy of the Decree Establishing Title nor was he informed of its entry and discovered the entry on July 15, when he asked a clerk from his office to review the court file. In Guam, the time for taking an appeal begins to run at the entry of the judgment, not upon notice of the entry of the judgment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b454-9\">According to 4 Am.Jur.2d Appeal and Error, Sec. 293, the power to extend the time to appeal may be conferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>upon the trial court by statute; however, if not conferred by statute, then the trial court has no inherent power to extend the time for taking an appeal. Perfection of the review proceeding within the time limited by statute or practice rule is jurisdictional. Consequently, the trial court had no power to grant an extension. The notice of appeal was untimely filed. This court is without jurisdiction to consider an appeal, which had been taken subsequent to the expiration of the statutory period. <em>Re Hanley, </em>23 Cal.2d 120, 142 P.2d 423.</p>\n    <p id=\"b455-3\">The appeal is hereby dismissed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The fact that no action was taken on this motion until February 28, 1958, and that in the meantime the appellee had filed a confirmatory or further motion to vacate the interlocutory decree of divorce is, in our opinion, immaterial and the Court\u2019s order vacating the interlocutory decree of divorce, dated February 28,1958, should be construed as based upon the motion filed November 29, 1957 which was clearly filed within the time limit permitted by Rule 60 referred to above.</p>\n    <p id=\"b62-11\">Counsel for the appellant has strenuously argued that the motion to vacate the interlocutory decree of divorce did not comply with the requirements of Section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and therefore should not have been granted, but we hold that Rule 60 of the Island Court of Guam, approved by the Judicial Council December 15, 1954, to be effective January 1, 1955, has superseded the limitations in Section 473 insofar as the rule is inconsistent therewith. The rule was one of those adopted under Section 123 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides, in part: \u201cAll laws of Guam in conflict with such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>rules shall he of no further force and effect after they take effect.\u201d</p>\n    <p id=\"b63-3\">Any defect there may have been in the original service of process in this case has been cured by the filing of an appearance for the appellee, the motion to vacate interlocutory decree of divorce, and the appellee\u2019s answer filed February 18, 1958.</p>\n    <p id=\"b63-4\">The Island Court\u2019s order vacating interlocutory decree is accordingly affirmed and the case remanded to the Island Court for further proceedings.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Schenck, the plaintiff herein, departed Truk Island to sojourn in Guam in hopes of obtaining a Therapeutic Abortion. After several inquiries, she found her way to Dr. Vivian Batoyan, a private physician who has privileges at the Guam Memorial Hospital, which is operated by the Government of Guam. The Government is the named defendant in the above-entitled action. After a brief consultation with Dr. Batoyan, she was referred to our Mental Health Clinic for consultation and was seen by Dr. David Kennedy, the Director of the Guam Memorial Hospital Mental Health Center. The consultation occurred on August 16, 1973, and after a brief examination, the psychiatrist concluded termination of pregnancy was essential and recommended sterilization. (See Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit A.) The history Dr. Batoyan shows is that the plaintiff was spotting. This was contradicted by the plaintiff in her testimony; and the nurse\u2019s notes-medication record in Exhibit A shows no bleeding noted.</p>\n    <p id=\"b287-5\">The entire hospital record was offered into evidence as Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit A. The hospital record revealed an Admitting and Final Diagnosis as Incomplete Abortion, 8 weeks. The operation report shows Dilatation and Curettage was performed. There was a moderate amount of tissue obtained from the lining of the cavity of the uterus (endometrium), and the tissue was sent for surgical pathology. Dr. Leung Chen, the Staff Pathologist for the Guam Memorial Hospital, only had a pre-operation diagnosis (see Surgical Pathology Report, part of Exhibit A) of Incomplete Abortion, and concluded that no fetal parts were found.</p>\n    <p id=\"b287-6\">Mrs. Schenck, after her discharge, returned to Truk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Island, and in October 1978, began experiencing difficulty with her uterus. She then sought medical advice in Truk and was seen by Dr. G. C. Hobson, who testified in this case. In his report, he stated that he suspected \u2019 a possible hydatidiform mole. His operation finding was a 4 month pregnancy. Pathology reported \u201cFetal, placental, and decidual tissue identified.\u201d The surgeon, Dr. Hobson, testified that bleeding during surgery became so great after fetal parts were removed, that he performed a hysterectomy.</p>\n    <p id=\"b288-5\">The plaintiff testified that great mental anguish, embarrassment, and humiliation have been suffered and that she has been advised that future psychiatric care is necessary, which stems from the loss of her uterus, which totaled to approximately $38,855.00.</p>\n    <p id=\"b288-6\">The plaintiff in this case now seeks to recover damages for negligent medical and hospital treatment, which eventually led to a hysterectomy. This action is based on the theory that the defendant hospital owed a duty to plaintiff to provide reasonable medical care and supervision during her confinement in August 1973.</p>\n    <p id=\"b288-7\">In seeking the standard of care that is to be exercised by the hospital, this Court has been aided by an expert witness, Dr. G. C. Hobson, the By-Laws of the Medical Staff of the Guam Memorial Hospital, and the Accreditation Manual for Hospital, up-dated 1973 (Exhibits B and C). The hospitals of today, unlike the hospitals of yesteryears, have a network of facilities; such as, medical staff laboratories, X-ray Department, Administrative and Manual Workers, all acting in concert for the benefit of the patients it accepts. As stated in <em>Bing v. Thieng </em>(1957) 2 N.Y.S. 656, the Court said, \u201cThe conception that the hospital does not undertake to treat a patient, does not undertake to act through its doctors, nurses, but undertakes instead simply to procure them to act upon their own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>responsibility no longer reflects the fact. The standards for Hospital Accreditation, state licensing and the defendant\u2019s by-laws, demonstrate that the medical profession and other responsible authorities regard it as both desirable and feasible that the hospital assume certain responsibilities for the care of the patient.\u201d</p>\n    <p id=\"b289-3\">It is crystal clear that compliance with the By-Laws and the Manual for Hospital Accreditation was ignored during the confinement of this patient. There was no clinical history sent with the tissue to the pathologist. The pathologist made no inquiry after finding no fetal parts. No Medical Review Committee was in existence to review medical records. No Tissue Committee to review surgical procedure. The hospital records indicated Incomplete Abortion as an admitting and final diagnosis. The psychiatrist, Dr. David Kennedy, recommended Therapeutic Abortion.</p>\n    <p id=\"b289-4\">It is a sad commentary and shocking to this Court that there is no established policy on Therapeutic Abortion, other than a brief consultation with a psychiatrist. It is difficult for this Court to comprehend how a surgeon, without the harness of strict regulation, can extinguish the lamp of life with a lethal curet as the defenseless fetus is evacuated by the surgeon. Individual rights play such a prominent rule in our modern day society, with the exception of the fetus, which is <em>life </em>[emphasis supplied].</p>\n    <p id=\"b289-5\">Had there been a Medical Review of Records, an inquisitive pathologist, a Tissue Committee Rules &amp; Regulations governing Therapeutic Abortion, review of operative procedure, the plaintiff would not have walked out of the halls pregnant, which later subjected her to a hysterectomy. Citing <em>Hendrickson v. Hadkin, </em>294 N.Y.S. 982; <em>Darling v. Charleston Community Memorial Hospital </em>(1965) 33 Ill.2d 253; 14 A.L.R.3d 873.</p>\n    <p id=\"b289-6\">Based upon the evidence of this case, which show a total disregard in providing reasonable medical care and super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>vision, there can be one conclusion reached. Judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $80,000.00 against the defendant Government of Guam, together with cost and disbursement.</p>\n    <p id=\"b290-3\">Submit judgment.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The remaining judges constitute a quorum to consider this appeal. The Pacific Far East Line, Inc., a foreign corporation, originally began this action by filing a complaint in the Island Court of Guam against the appellee and the government of Guam. The case was dismissed against the government of Guam and no appeal was perfected. The appellant filed an amended complaint against the appellee, and in the first paragraph of the complaint, it alleged that the plaintiff was a corporation authorized to do business and doing business in the territory of Guam. A motion for summary judgment filed by the appellee was granted and a motion to amend the complaint to make a different party plaintiff was denied. The basis for summary judgment was that the plaintiff below had not qualified to do business in Guam. We do not consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the question as to whether a corporation engaged in interstate commerce may have the Courts of Guam closed to it. That question is not presented here. The plaintiff alleged that it was qualified to do business in Guam and was doing business in Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b75-3\">Section 407 of the Civil Code of Guam provides as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b75-4\">\u201cNo foreign corporation or corporation formed, organized, or existing under any laws other than those of Guam shall be permitted to transact business in Guam or maintain by itself or assignee any suit for the recovery of any debt, claim, or demand whatever, unless it shall have the license prescribed in this chapter. Any officer, director, or agent of the corporation or any person transacting business for any foreign corporation not having the license prescribed shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than 6 months or by a fine of not more than $500, or by both such imprisonment and fine, in the discretion of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b75-5\">The appellant was not authorized to transact business in Guam as alleged in its complaint. This would appear to be jurisdictional. Since the original complaint could have been dismissed for this failure, the Court was without authority to permit the substitution of a different party plaintiff. When the Court was advised by the motion for summary judgment, with attached proofs, that the plaintiff had not complied with the corporation law of Guam, it had no alternative except to dismiss.</p>\n    <p id=\"b75-6\">We again emphasize that we are relying upon the allegations made in the amended complaint; that we are not holding one way or the other as to whether Section 407 would be valid as against a plaintiff engaged in interstate commerce but not engaged in business in Guam. Reference is made to <em>Maria A. Dezell, et al. v. E. E. Black, Ltd., et al., </em>191 F.Supp. 635, in which the late Judge Gilmartin had occasion to determine as to whether a defendant insurance company in a wrongful death action could be required to comply with the Insurance Code in Guam. The Court noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>that the defendant insurance company had not engaged in any local activities and denied the motion. Certainly if the defendant insurance company had alleged that it was authorized to do business in Guam and was doing business in Guam, a different question would have been presented. The determination in the Island Court is affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

That appellants are not entitled to an injunction against appellee.</p>\n    <p id=\"b210-10\">2. That appellees are entitled to damages in the sum of $350.00 for the maintaining by the appellants of an encroachment on the southerly wall of appellants\u2019 building into .the adjoining right of way.</p>\n    <p id=\"b210-11\">3. That appellants\u2019 rights in Chamorrita Drive are those of ingress and egress only.</p>\n    <p id=\"b210-12\">4. That the garbage can and platform, and storm drains, constitute a burden on the servient estate, and that appellants be required to remove these.</p>\n    <p id=\"b210-13\">Study of the record and citations of law fail to reveal any clear error in the record as to any of the matters complained of except as the decision relates to the storm drains.</p>\n    <p id=\"b210-14\">Appellants\u2019 attack on the Island Court\u2019s finding that appellants\u2019 rights in Chamorrita Drive are those of egress and ingress only constitute a misreading of the' Island Court\u2019s finding on this matter, since this finding does not include the word \u201conly\u201d and the question of the limits of appellants\u2019 rights in Chamorrita Drive was not before the Island Court except as to certain specific allegations of excessive use relating to garbage cans, platforms, and storm drains.</p>\n    <p id=\"b210-15\">As to the catch basin off drain pipes, this Court finds that there is no substantial evidence to support a holding that such basin and drains were an unreasonable use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Chamorrita Drive since the Island Court refused to permit appellants to put on evidence on this issue despite repeated offers of proof.</p>\n    <p id=\"b211-3\">Appellees stipulated in open court at the time of the oral argument before this Court that they would agree to a remand to the Island Court for further evidence and argument on this issue of whether the basin and drains were an unreasonable use of Chamorrita Drive or in the alternative, that a judgment issue which will run with the land (now occupied by appellants adjacent to the basin and drains), that the catch basin and drains may remain in place, but that if offer of dedication of Chamorrita Drive is made to the Government of Guam and if acceptance by the Government is conditioned on the removal of such basin and drain, appellants and their successors in interest to the land they now occupy adjacent to the catch basin and drains would then agree to remove the catch basin and drains and agree to being enjoined from continuing to maintain them.</p>\n    <p id=\"b211-4\">Appellants having agreed orally in open court in the presence of and with the concurrence of appellee to the latter alternative, it is so ordered and the case is remanded to the Island Court for a judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    <p id=\"b211-5\">As to all other matters, no clear error having been found, the judgment of the Island Court is affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Defendants in their motion to dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>filed on July 15,1976, allege both pre-indictment delay and alteration of the indictment. This court finds no cause to dismiss on either .ground as there is no prima facie showing of prejudice here to Defendants\u2019 rights to due process or a fair trial.</p>\n    <p id=\"b368-5\">As to the alteration in the indictment, the case law is clear that a change in the date to correct a typographical or clerical error goes to form only and is not prejudicial. (See <em>Arnold v. U.S., </em>C.A. 9th, 1964, 336 F.2d 347, 353, certiorari denied 85 S.Ct. 1348, 380 U.S. 982, 14 L.Ed.2d 275; <em>Berg v. U.S., </em>C.A. 9th, 1949, 176 F.2d 122, 126). The indictment here was changed from October 1976 to October 1975 and initialed by the Assistant Attorney General who made the correction. In a very similar case decided by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals the October 23, 1962, date was corrected to 1961, and the court stated \u201c. . . This obvious clerical mistake was in no way prejudicial. As the 1962 date had not yet arrived, the intent of the indictment could not have misled anyone\u201d. <em>(U.S. v. Zembito, </em>C.A. 4th, 1963, 315 F.2d 266, certiorari denied 83 S.Ct. 1524, 373 U.S. 924, 10 L.Ed.2d 423). Clearly this is harmless error under Rule 52(a) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure for the Superior Court of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b368-6\">As to the allegation of prejudicial pre-indictment delay, <em>U.S. v. Quinn, </em>C.A. 8th (July 27, 1976) expresses the appropriate standard:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b368-7\">In determining whether a dismissal due to pretrial delay is proper, this court has balanced the reasonableness of the delay against the resulting prejudice to the defendant . . . applying this test we scrutinize the facts surrounding the delay and then determine whether the defendant has been substantially prejudiced . . .</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b368-8\">The <em>Quinn </em>Court then cited <em>U.S. v. Jackson, </em>504 F.2d 337, n. 1, 16 Cr. L. 2020, which states at page 339 \u201c. . . at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>least where the government is not engaging in intentional delay in order to gain a tactical advantage over the accused, the defendant must affirmatively demonstrate prejudice\u201d.</p>\n    <p id=\"b369-3\">As in <em>Quinn </em>undercover activity relating to other offenses might have been jeopardized had prosecutions been \u25a0brought immediately after these defendants did the alleged acts. Accordingly, a delay of eight (8) months is not unreasonable and Defendants have failed to affirmatively demonstrate prejudice.</p>\n    <p id=\"b369-4\">In accord with the foregoing, the motion to dismiss is hereby denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b369-5\">Submit order.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Judge</em></author>\n    <p id=\"b610-5\">DECISION AND ORDER</p>\n    <p id=\"b610-6\">Plaintiff moved this court on September 15, 1978, to disqualify Daniel Del Priore, Acting Deputy Attorney General, or any other attorney in the employ of the Attorney General\u2019s Office, from acting as counsel for defendant in the above-entitled action. Both the plaintiff, through its attorney of record, Ruth Hall, Esq., and the defendant, through his attorney of record, Daniel R. Del Priore, Esq., submitted memoranda of points and authorities in support of their respective positions as to this issue. In addition to his memorandum of points and authorities, defendant submitted for the court\u2019s consideration a letter dated September 21, 1978, and signed by the Honorable Ricardo J. Bordado, Governor of Guam, stating in pertinent part, \u201cIt is in the interest of the government of Guam that I authorize the Office of the Attorney General to represent General Jacobsen in the [above-entitled] suit. * * * The authority for my authorization stems from \u00a7 7007 of the Government Code of Guam.\u201d</p>\n    <p id=\"b610-7\">Oral argument on the plaintiff\u2019s motion was held on September 22, 1978, before the undersigned. Plaintiff\u2019s position, stated generally, is that the above-entitled action has been brought against the defendant in his individual capacity, rather in his capacity as the Acting Attorney Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>eral of the territory of Guam. This being the case, plaintiff argues, the Office of the Attorney General is without the capacity to represent the defendant under the laws of the territory of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b611-3\">Defendant\u2019s position, stated generally, has two main thrusts. Defendant first argues that the current posture of this action is that plaintiff has merely petitioned for leave to file its complaint in quo warranto, but that the said petition has not yet been heard. This being the case, defendant argues, there is no action currently pending against the defendant and thus plaintiff\u2019s motion to disqualify defendant\u2019s counsel is premature. This argument overlooks the reality of the situation at hand. Plaintiff has filed in this court the necessary papers to institute its action in quo warranto against the defendant, and although that petition has not yet been heard, it is clear that the instant litigation has in fact ensued. This court therefore finds defendant\u2019s first argument unpersuasive.</p>\n    <p id=\"b611-4\">Defendant next argues that the Office of the Attorney General has the capacity to represent the defendant herein under the statutory authority of \u00a7 7007(b) of the Government Code of Guam, which reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b611-5\">(b) Nothing herein shall be interpreted to preclude the participation of the Attorney General in any litigation in order to protect the interests of the government of Guam....</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b611-6\">Counsel for defendant argues that the above-mentioned letter from Governor Bordallo indicates the interest of the government of Guam in the above-entitled action, and that therefore the Office of the Attorney General has the capacity to represent the defendant herein. The court finds this second argument equally unpersuasive.</p>\n    <p id=\"b611-7\">With all due deference to Governor Bordallo\u2019s opinion as to what constitutes \u201cthe interest of the government of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Guam\u201d, the facts remain that the government of Guam is not a party to the instant action and that the instant action has been filed against the defendant as an individual, not against the defendant in his capacity as the Acting Attorney General of the territory of Guam. Were this court to permit the Office of the Attorney General to represent the defendant herein on the basis of Governor Bordallo\u2019s assertions as set forth in the above-mentioned letter, then nothing in logic would prevent the Governor of Guam from asserting \u201cthe interest of the government of Guam\u201d in <em>any </em>lawsuit that might be brought in this court and on that basis instruct the Office of the Attorney General to represent one party or another in such a lawsuit. Such is clearly not within the statutory scheme of Title VIII, Chapter 1 of the Government Code of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b612-5\">This court having read the memoranda of points and authorities submitted by the parties, and having heard argument upon the issues raised by the plaintiff\u2019s instant motion to disqualify counsel, this court is of the opinion that plaintiff\u2019s motion is meritorious and that defendant\u2019s arguments in opposition thereto are unpersuasive. It is therefore</p>\n    <p id=\"b612-6\">ORDERED, that plaintiff\u2019s motion to disqualify Daniel Del Priore, Esq., or any other attorney in the employ of the Office of the Attorney General of the territory of Guam, from acting as counsel for defendant in the above-entitled action be, and it is hereby, GRANTED. Mr. Del Priore shall notify defendant of such disqualification personally or by registered mail, and submit proof of such notice to this court on or before Tuesday, September 26, 1978.</p>\n    <p id=\"b612-7\">ORDERED, that defendant\u2019s request for an order requiring plaintiff to post a cash bond in the amount of $10,000.00 prior to proceeding with its suit, in that the said request is based upon a provision of the California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Code of Civil Procedure which is of no force or applicability in the territory of Guam, be, and it is hereby DENIED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The appellants claim that the action of unlawful detainer brought by the Government of Guam here is barred by the ten year limitation in that Section.</p>\n    <p id=\"b60-11\">It is clear that the land in question did not become the property of the Government of Guam until after the adoption of the Organic Act of Guam, which was approved August 1, 1950, and pursuant to the terms of which the Government of Guam acquired title. Before that, the land was owned by the United States and we hold that the limitation imposed by Section 315 of the Code of Civil Procedure could not and did not run against the United States. See <em>Oaksmith v. Johnston, </em>92 U.S. 343, 23 L.Ed. 682 (1875); <em>Morrow v. Whitney, </em>95 U.S. 551, 24 L.Ed. 456 (1877); <em>Sparks v. Pierce, </em>115 U.S. 408, 6 S.Ct. 102, 29 L.Ed. 428 (1885).</p>\n    <p id=\"b60-12\">We are furthermore of the opinion that Section 315 must be construed in conjunction with Section 326 of the Code of Civil Procedure which provides that where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>tenant is holding over under a written lease which has expired, his possession shall not be considered adverse .. until the expiration of five years from the termination of the tenancy.\u201d In this instance, the lease expired, by its terms, June 6, 1944. Under Section 326, however, the tenant\u2019s possession did not become adverse until June 7, 1949. From the record in this case, there is nothing to indicate the appellants ever rescinded or repudiated, or purported to do so, by any positive action, their landlord-tenant relationship with the United States.</p>\n    <p id=\"b61-3\">We therefore hold that the ten year limitation of Section 315 did not begin to run until June 7, 1949 and that the action, being brought on December 10, 1954, was clearly within this ten year period.</p>\n    <p id=\"b61-4\">The judgment of the Island Court in favor of the appellee is hereby affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

A\u00e9tna did not file a claim with the Attorney General of Guam pursuant to the requirements of the Government Claims Act. Both plaintiff and defendant have filed motions for summary judgment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b643-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>The Government raises the defense of sovereign immunity contending that suits against the Government can only be brought insofar as the Government has consented to be sued. Counsel for Aetna urges the Court to reject the defense of sovereign immunity, citing the 1978 Supreme Court of Pennsylvania case of <em>Mayle v. Pennsylvania Department of Highways, </em>388 A.2d 709, in which the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania by a 4 to 3 decision reversed a Pennsylvania Trial Court that had ruled that sovereign immunity applied in a tort action against the State of Pennsylvania for personal injuries.</p>\n    <p id=\"b643-3\">The Government of Guam Claims Act, \u00a7 6500.01 of the Government Code of Guam, states- in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b643-4\">Waiver of immunity. The government of Guam hereby waives immunity from liability, but only as hereinafter provided:</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b643-5\">(a) for all expenses incurred in reliance upon a contract to which the Government of Guam or any of its departments, agencies or funds is a party, but if the contract has been substantially completed, expectation damages may be awarded;</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b643-6\">The Government of Guam Claims Act, \u00a7 6500.03 et seq., requires the filing of a claim with the Attorney General as a condition precedent to the filing of an action against the Government in the Superior Court of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b643-7\">Counsel for Aetna claimed in oral argument that filing a claim with the Attorney General would be useless because the nature of the contractual obligation falls outside of the waiver provisions of \u00a7 6500.01, cited above. However, Aetna is in no worse position than the victim of -an intentional tort committed by Federal agent or employee. 28 U.S.C.A. 2680 (Tort Claims Procedure) provides as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b643-8\">The provisions of this Chapter and \u00a7 1346(b) of this title shall not apply to\u2014</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights: . . .</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b644-5\">72 Am.Jur.2d, States, Territories and Dependencies, reads as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b644-6\">\n      <em>Section 99. General rule as to state\u2019s immunity from suit.</em>\n    </blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b644-7\">The general principal of jurisprudence that the sovereign cannot be sued without its own consent applies with full force to the several states of the Union. Accordingly, no suit, whether at law or in equity, is maintainable against the state either in its own courts or in the courts of a sister state, by its own citizens, by the citizens of another state, or by the citizens or subjects of a foreign state, unless the state has given its consent or otherwise waived its immunity. The state\u2019s immunity from suit without its consent is absolute and unqualified, and a constitutional provision securing it is not to be so construed as to place the state within the reach of the process of the court....</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b644-8\">\n      <em>Section 167. Actions against territories.</em>\n    </blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b644-9\">The incorporated territories have always been held to possess an immunity from suit without their consent, and although a territory is not an integral part of the United States, the same rule should apply. And the same immunity has been held to apply to unincorporated territories....</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b644-10\">The Organic Act of Guam, 48 U.S.C.A. 1421a, provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b644-11\">\n      <em>Section 1121a.

The title of the heirs did not originate in the decree of distribution, but came to them from their ancestor; and the settlement of the estate in the probate court, and the final decree of distribution in that court, only served to release their property from the conditions to which, as the estate of a deceased person, it was subject.\u201d <em>Bates v.

Nothing remained to be done. Therefore, the statute of limitations has no application to the facts of the instant case.</p>\n    <p id=\"b205-5\">The Court concludes that the lower court was in error in nullifying the transaction evidenced by the deed from Rosa Cruz Quinata to Jose Perez Guerrero and his wife, Dolores Quinata Guerrero, and that said cause should be remanded to the lower court and a decree entered confirming title to said property in the appellant, subject to any liens, as provided by the Probate Code of the Territory of Guam.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

As a result of the collision one person in the other car was killed and others seriously injured. An information was filed in the Island Court of Guam under date of March 14, 1962 charging him with reckless driving causing bodily injuries in violation of Section 23407 (b) of the Government Code of Guam. After the passenger died the defendant was charged with involuntary manslaughter in the District Court of Guam and was acquitted in a trial to jury. He was then brought .to trial in the Island Court on the reckless driving charge and there convicted. He appealed and assigns numerous errors. We agree with the government that these can be grouped into three general headings, i.e., double jeopardy, sufficiency of the evidence, and .failure to be bound by the testimony of defendant\u2019s expert witnesses.</p>\n    <p id=\"b114-8\">\n      <em>Double Jeopardy</em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"b114-9\">The District Court of Guam has no jurisdiction over local misdemeanors. In <em>Hatchett v. The Government of Guam, </em>212 F.2d 767, defendant was charged with involuntary manslaughter and two misdemeanors. He was given concurrent sentences on the misdemeanor convictions and sentenced on the involuntary manslaughter conviction. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Court of Appeals reversed for the failure ,to proceed by indictment in the felony charge. The Court then said:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b115-3\">The other two charges upon which Hatchett was convicted, were for violation of the Guam Vehicle Code. The maximum imprisonment for either was six months. As they were misdemeanors, the court should have transferred the proceedings, as it concerned these charges, to the Island Court for determination. Public Law 17\u2014 First Guam Legislature, Sec. 62, 82. The judgment as to these charges is reversed and the proceedings remanded with direction to transfer the proceedings to the Island Court.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b115-4\">The case of <em>People v. Herbert, 58 </em>P.2d 909, 6 C.2d 541 clearly holds:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b115-5\">A conviction of both said offenses (manslaughter and reckless driving) is not an impairment of the twice in jeopardy provision of the constitution, or a violation of the penal statute. They are not the same offenses nor is one . . . , necessarily included within the other.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b115-6\">The defendant was not subjected to double jeopardy.</p>\n    <p id=\"b115-7\">\n      <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"b115-8\">The Court below found that the point of impact of the collision was about two feet within the lane of travel of the other car; that the defendant had crossed the center line in a no passing zone and that the defendant was clinically intoxicated, Tr. p. 177. All of these findings are amply supported by the evidence. It is not the function of an appellate court to weigh disputed evidence if there is evidence to support the findings of the trier of fact..</p>\n    <p id=\"b115-9\">The evidence that the defendant was clinically intoxicated at the time of the accident is conclusive. Our attention is directed to the case of <em>Marte v. Government of Guam, </em>115 F.Supp. 524 which was reversed in an opinion by the late Judge McLaughlin which pointed out that the examining doctor based his conclusion of intoxication on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>the conduct of the accused without an examination. In the present case the accused had attended a stag brunch where he drank straight whiskey over a period of about four hours. When he was treated at the Naval Hospital for head injuries the doctor who treated him testified, Tr. pp. 56 and 57:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b116-5\">Q. What observation did you make concerning intoxication or lack of intoxication?</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b116-6\">A. It was my opinion that in observing him over this period of time, smelling alcohol on his breath, from his manner of speech, his lack of coordination, his general behavior, that he was clinically intoxicated.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b116-7\">The crossing of the center line in a no passing zone was testified to by an employee of the government of Guam, Tr. p. 12, who testified that the defendant passed him while going 60 miles an hour and drove onto the opposite lane of travel where his car struck the other car.</p>\n    <p id=\"b116-8\">The Court found that the point <em>of </em>impact was within the opposite lane of travel as testified to by the police investigators and other witnesses. There was ample testimony to support all of the Court\u2019s findings. The fact that contrary evidence was given by the defense witnesses does not affect the responsibility of the trier of fact to accept or reject evidence in arriving at his conclusion.</p>\n    <p id=\"b116-9\">\n      <em>Defendant\u2019s Expert Witnesses</em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"b116-10\">The defendant offered no testimony by any person who saw the accident or who investigated it immediately thereafter. Witnesses for the defendant testified as alleged experts on the basis of their examination of photographs, subsequent examination of the wrecked cars and study of the accident site. Defense counsel attempted, through hypothetical questions, to develop the defendant\u2019s contention that the accident took place in the defendant\u2019s lane of travel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>rather than the opposite lane. The defendant completely overlooked the fact that the Court was trying a reckless driving case, not a civil damage case. It can hardly be claimed that a clinically intoxicated driver, driving at an excessive speed and crossing a no passing line just prior to the impact was not guilty of reckless driving, regardless of whether there was or was not contributory negligence on the part of the driver of the other car. While the Court stated that it struck the testimony of these witnesses, it made it clear that it found such testimony of no assistance in determining the issue of reckless driving. Nor do we.</p>\n    <p id=\"b117-3\">We cannot close this opinion without pointing out that the Court below had to contend with constant and unnecessary bickering between counsel, climaxed by the accusation of defense counsel that the defendant could not obtain a fair trial in the Island Court. It is to be regretted that a member of the Guam Bar so forgot himself as to impugn the integrity of the Court. The defense counsel is herewith reprimanded. Judgment below affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Appellant claimed that the owner of Lot No. 3397-2 knew or should have known of fifteen years of open, notorious, continuous, uninterrupted, adverse use of .the road as the only means of ingress and. egress to Lot No. 3377, and claimed that such use had matured into a perpetual prescriptive easement.</p>\n    <p id=\"b213-11\">Evidence was taken and decisi\u00f3n adverse to appellant was entered on October 1, 1970, and based upon said decision, a decree establishing title in \u00e1ppellees was entered October 2, 1970, and an amended decree establishing title was entered October 12, 1970. Appellant appeals from the two decrees.</p>\n    <p id=\"b213-12\">The evidence clearly establishes peaceable, continuous, uninterrupted, and open use for the prescriptive period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>time and .that appellee knew or should have known of this use; and the trial court apparently does not question the fact that these tests for prescription were met by appellant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b214-5\">The trial court, however, concluded that the use of the roadway was \u201cpermissive\u201d and ruled against appellant on this basis. The sole question in this appeal, therefore, is whether the trial court\u2019s finding of \u201cpermissive\u201d use rather than use under a claim of right is clearly erroneous.</p>\n    <p id=\"b214-6\">The decision stated the following evidentiary facts, all of which are amply supported by the evidence. This Eiban property is cultivated for her personal use and she goes to the land several times a week; the roadway was used by Eiban to reach her property for more than the statutory ten years; the owner of the servient estate had knowledge that this road was used by Eiban for ingress and egress to gather her crops; the roadway was established by the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II and was used by Eiban since 1952 for the purpose of gaining access to her property.</p>\n    <p id=\"b214-7\">The decision is somewhat ambiguous on the question of whether or not the roadway is the sole means of access to appellant\u2019s property, since it states appellant\u2019s contention that \u201cthe roadway is the only means of ingress and egress\u201d and \u201cIt was further shown that this was the only access to the property\u201d (P. 2) and refers to no evidence or contention of any additional access. Yet the decision further states, \u201cThere was another access to the Eiban property by way of the northern boundary line.\u201d P. 4.</p>\n    <p id=\"b214-8\">The finding of another access during the pertinent prescriptive period of time, if such were meant to be the trial court\u2019s findings, would be clearly erroneous. Attorney for appellees admitted during oral argument that there is no other access. A search of the record shows no evidence of any other access during the prescriptive period or at the present time. The testimony and contentions that the road<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>way in question is the only access is not contradicted by any credible evidence. The testimony that a pre-war road which once existed to the north <em>no longer exists today </em>(Mrs. Eiban, Tr. 7-29-70, P. 45) is not contradicted.</p>\n    <p id=\"b215-3\">Further evidence pertinent to the issue of \u201cpermissive\u201d use shows that the husband of Appellant Theodore M. Eiban used the road once a week since 1952 in order to go to the beach or picnic, get dirt for flowers, and pick firewood. Tr. 7-29-70, P. 21. Said use continued until the road was blocked by a barricade in October, 1969. Tr. 7-20-70, P. 23. Elizabeth Campos Toves, appellant\u2019s niece, used the road from 1952 to 1969 to get to the beach (Tr. 7-29-70, P. 33-34); appellant used the road from 1952 to 1970; she used the road three or four times a week, sometimes every day, to haul water, to take care of her cow and chicken, to get dirt and cow manure and firewood. Tr. 7-29-70, P. 41-42. She used Lot No. 3377 for cultivating banana, coconut, pepper, and fruit trees; as well as for chickens and cows. Nobody ever stopped appellant\u2019s use of the road until April, 1970 when Mrs. Rosario M. Campos, owner of the property on which the roadway is located, told appellant that she was closing the road because she did not like Mrs. Eiban\u2019s niece and her niece\u2019s husband going into appellant\u2019s property. Tr. 7-29-70, P. 46.</p>\n    <p id=\"b215-4\">The testimony of Mrs. Campos can most charitably be described as confused. She denied the existence of the road (Tr. 7-16-70, P. 41); stated that she never saw appellant use the road (Tr. 7-16-70, P. 40); and that she only saw appellant use the road twice (Tr. 7-16-70, P. 45). Mrs. Campos uses her property every day to feed her pigs. Tr. 7-16-70, P. 38. Mrs. Campos did not give appellant permission to go back and forth over her property. Tr. 7-16-70, P. 44.</p>\n    <p id=\"b215-5\">The question of whether use is permissive or hostile is generally a question of fact for the trial court, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>finding will be upheld if there is any substantial evidence to support it. <em>Van Amersfoot v. Young, </em>232 P.2d 569 (1951).</p>\n    <p id=\"b216-5\">The principal problem in this case, however, does not concern the weight which a trial judge gave to evidentiary facts, but rather the question of whether an incorrect legal standard was used in deriving the ultimate fact of \u201cpermissive\u201d user from the evidentiary facts.</p>\n    <p id=\"b216-6\">The trial court erred in failing to consider the fact that the roadway was the only outlet as a fact tending to show that the use was adverse. Even in wasteland, where there is a strong presumption that use is permissive, there is a strong body of case law to the effect:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b216-7\">\u201cThe use of a passway through unenclosed woodland and wastelands may be proven to be adverse where the passway in question was the only outlet to public highways available to the claimant thereof.\u201d 46 A.L.R.2d 1154, Par. 4, and the cases cited therein.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b216-8\">In <em>Van Amersfoot v. Young, </em>supra, a case factually close to this one, the California Supreme Court found that the fact that there was no other access other than the claimed easement was a pertinent fact to consider as supportive of a claim of adverseness, rather than permissive use.</p>\n    <p id=\"b216-9\">Certainly, by the \u201creasonable man\u201d test, a landowner whose neighbor uses his property as the <em>ONLY </em>means of access to the neighbor\u2019s land would have more reason to believe his neighbor is acting under a claim of right than the landowner whose neighbor passes through his property as an alternate route.</p>\n    <p id=\"b216-10\">The trial court erred in its decision in including among the elements that must be shown for an easement by prescription that \u201c. . . it must be exclusive.\u201d P. 3.</p>\n    <p id=\"b217-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>To make .the test for a prescriptive access easement, the right to \u201cexclusive\u201d use, would be to virtually eliminate this kind of easement from our body of the law. <em>Bernstein v. Dodik, </em>129 Cal.App. 454, 18 P.2d 983, 985 (1933) cited to support the trial court\u2019s statement that an easement by prescription must be \u201cexclusive\u201d is an excellent example of a non-exclusive prescriptive easement, thus:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b217-3\">\u201cThe use of said right of way by respondents and their grantors (claiming the easement) was not impaired by the enjoyment of a like right by appellants (owners of servient estate) and others.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b217-4\">There is no substantial evidence in this case to support a finding of permissive user. The trial court\u2019s finding that appellant paid no taxes on the road is correct, but this does not negate prescription in an easement.</p>\n    <p id=\"b217-5\">The recent case of <em>Taormino v. Denny, </em>83 Cal.Rptr. 359, 463 P.2d 711, 716 (1970) clearly establishes that the elements necessary to establish a prescriptive easement are identical to adverse possession, \u201c. . . with the exception of the requirement that taxes be paid.\u201d</p>\n    <p id=\"b217-6\">The only credible evidence in this case shows such actual, open, notorious, uninterrupted, continuous, peaceable use of a roadway as the only means of access to cultivated property for fifteen years as to make the adverse nature of the use the only reasonable inference. See <em>Jones v. Young, </em>147 Cal.App.2d 496, 305 P.2d 286. The circumstances of the use gave the owner who visited daily, constructive notice that user was under a claim of right. A cause of action for trespass accrued to the owner, who having failed to take any action to protect her title for the ten-year statutory period, has now lost her right to protest.</p>\n    <p id=\"b217-7\">Viewing the record as a whole, we find no substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding of permissive use. We hold, therefore, that the finding of permissive use is clearly erroneous, and that the appellant has a prescrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>tive easement of egress and ingress going over a coral road on the property of Appellee Rosario Manibusan Campos. The decrees appealed from are therefore reversed and .the case is remanded to the trial court for action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The trial court held denial of the variance permitting construction of the second storey den by the Territorial Planning Commission was not an abuse of discretion and therefore the denial was valid as a matter of law.</p>\n    <p id=\"b235-9\">We affirm.</p>\n    <p id=\"b235-10\">The Island Court made no finding of facts and we cannot do so but we do find the evidence supports the court\u2019s conclusions and they are not, therefore, \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d The court permitted appellant to \u201cuse and enjoy\u201d the completed carport without the den, even though, strangely enough, appellant challenges the validity of the permit under which it was constructed. On the basis of that challenge we could, and perhaps should, reverse and remand with direction the carport be removed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The appellant challenged the authority of the building inspector to delete the second storey den, urging in support Section 31026(b), Guam Government Code, to the effect that if an application is not in conformity with zoning or building law .the permit shall not issue, the plans of the applicant shall be returned with a written reason for denial. Issuance of a permit under the circumstances says appellant, is contrary to the statute. If that is so, then the permit was void and construction of the carport without lawful authority.</p>\n    <p id=\"b236-5\">The more generous, view of the trial court which permits appellant to retain the carport may be sustained as a matter of law by Section 31030(b) Government Code, which permits the building inspector to correct \u201cany errors\u201d in the plans and specifications. By its judgment the trial court treated the deletion of the second storey den as a proper correction of the plans.</p>\n    <p id=\"b236-6\">The sole controverted issue was whether the denial of a variance from the fifteen foot setback line was arbitrary or not and depends upon whether appellants were able to bring themselves within the statute, Section 17300 (d), permitting restoration of a partially destroyed nonconforming building. To do this he was required to prove the existence of the carport prior to Typhoon Karen in 1962, which purportedly destroyed the carport.</p>\n    <p id=\"b236-7\">Passing the question whether the delay of ten years in seeking ,to restore a nonconforming use constituted an abandonment and therefore required denial of restoration, because the question was not raised in the trial court nor on appeal, we consider the effect of the conflict of evidence as to whether a carport was in existence prior to Typhoon Karen. The trial court did not resolve the conflict by a finding. The court merely concluded there was no abuse of discretion by the Territorial Planning Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>in its denial of a variance to permit construction of the second storey den. As to the carport itself, the trial court\u2019s conclusion appellant may retain the carport as built, without the den, the court necessarily concluded the prior nonconforming carport was restored, thus resolving the conflict in evidence as to the prior existence of the carport.</p>\n    <p id=\"b237-3\">There was no evidence as to the prior existence of a second storey den and there was no statutory authority to permit its construction contrary to the zoning setback requirements. The denial of variance was not arbitrary, which is the basis for any reversal of .the Planning Commission decision.</p>\n    <p id=\"b237-4\">Upon the entire record the judgment of the Island Court is supported by evidence and law and is affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Palting, married the appellant, Jennie S. Palting. Thereafter, the deceased left the appellant and moved to Guam. In 1950 he went to Mexico and obtained a Mexican divorce decree. The trial court in its decision stated: \u201cNow factually and facially the decree appears to be nothing more than as commonly called a mail order divorce, wherein none of the parties have submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the Mexican Court.\u201d</p>\n    <p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>The trial court then proceeded to \u201cgive practical recognition\u201d to the divorce decree by holding that the appellant was estopped, after twenty some years, to question the validity of the Mexican divorce.</p>\n    <p id=\"b442-5\">The most that the record shows as far as appellant\u2019s participation or knowledge of the divorce is that she was served with the divorce papers in Washington, D.C., twenty days before the divorce decree was granted. There was no appearance by her in the action nor is there any evidence of any affirmative acts on her part or participation in the procurement of the decree.</p>\n    <p id=\"b442-6\">The cases cited by appellee which concede that the parties were subject to the jurisdiction of the court are not applicable here. The trial court found the divorce decree invalid and although the appellee argues that there is a presumption of validity to foreign decrees, <em>McGraw v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>64 P. 103; <em>Rediker v. Rediker, </em>221 P.2d 1, the court clearly found that the presumption had been overcome in that the court never acquired jurisdiction of the parties.</p>\n    <p id=\"b442-7\">The trial court based its conclusion that the appellant was estopped to question the validity of the decree on three cases. <em>Harlan v. Harlan, </em>161 P.2d 490; <em>Hensgen's Estate, </em>181 P.2d 69; <em>Hensgen v. Silberman, </em>197 P.2d 356. These cases demonstrate that if one actively participates or affirms acts or assists in procuring a divorce decree, he or she cannot later assert the invalidity of the divorce.</p>\n    <p id=\"b442-8\">The California courts have applied the doctrine of quasiestoppel to adjust or correct inequities where the facts so indicate. The courts there use a statute identical to one in Guam to support such a theory. Guam Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 1962(3). However, the crucial element must be found that the party to be estopped did some affirmative act or failed to act, or participated in some way to intentionally and deliberately lead another to believe a particular thing true.</p>\n    <p id=\"b443-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Assuming that the appellant was served with a copy of the divorce papers, there was no duty for her to obtain an attorney and appear or contest the divorce in a court which had no jurisdiction over her. To impose on the appellant such a duty could give validity to an otherwise invalid procedure by inadvertently giving the Mexican court jurisdiction.</p>\n    <p id=\"b443-3\">There is no evidence that the appellant remarried or used the Mexican decree to substantiate a claim or right. She simply treated it as an ineffectual document which in fact the trial court has confirmed. It was the deceased, Paul D. Palting, who procured the decree and thereafter relied upon it for his subsequent \u201cmarriages.\u201d If he had attempted to assert the invalidity of the Mexican divorce decree the doctrine of equitable estoppel may very well apply to him. However, it cannot be applied to prevent the appellant from questioning the decree even after twenty or more years.</p>\n    <p id=\"b443-4\">Appellee further argues in her brief that appellant is not entitled to share in the separate estate of the Estate of Paul D. Palting. This is a matter to be decided by the probate court and is not properly before this court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b443-5\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Judge Reyes issued a decision on August 6, 1974, as a Judge of the Superior Court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b464-12\">The quiet title action is based exclusively on a Deed of Conveyance signed by the late Maria Pangelinan Mendiola, conveying a piece of property to plaintiff. The piece of property is designated as:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b464-13\">Lot No. 5243-1-2, Municipality of Dededo, territory of Guam, containing an area of 20,532.95 square meters. CERTIFICATE OF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>TITLE NO................................................................................................. issued on .................................................................................................., 19.........</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b465-5\">The Deed of Conveyance was executed by Mrs. Mendiola on December 17, 1965. Mrs. Mendiola died on January 22, 1966. The defendants named in this action are the 10 children of Mrs. Mendiola. Her husband, Pedro C. Mendiola, is still living but waived all interest in her estate in favor of her children.</p>\n    <p id=\"b465-6\">It is clear from the evidence that Maria Mendiola owned a one-half (%) undivided interest in Lot No. 5243, Dededo, along with her brother, Vicente Rosario Pangelinan, by virtue of a Decree of Distribution entered on January 24, 1963, in Probate Case No. 446-48, which was the Probate Case of their late father, Carmelo Pangelinan Pangelinan.</p>\n    <p id=\"b465-7\">It is also clear from the evidence that there is no lot in Dededo designated as Lot No. 5243-1-2, nor is there any map on file in the Department of Land Management describing said lot.</p>\n    <p id=\"b465-8\">Plaintiff called two main witnesses in the case, the widower, Pedro Mendiola, and the agent of the plaintiff, William (Buddy) Lujan. The plaintiff himself had no firsthand knowledge of the facts in this case since all dealings had been made by his agent, Buddy.</p>\n    <p id=\"b465-9\">According to the testimony of Pedro Mendiola, sometime in the latter half of 1965 he and Maria had gone to Buddy Lujan\u2019s real estate office to ask him to do a survey of Lot No. 5243 and divide it into 10 parcels so that it could be registered and divided among their 10 children. According to Pedro, Buddy said that he would do the survey if they would sell him about 2 hectares of land for $2,000 and if they would pay him $1,500 for the survey. Buddy paid Maria a total of $1,500 before she died and two days after her death he paid Pedro $500. However, no survey was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>evidently done and no map was ever given to the Mendiolas. The Mendiolas never paid Lujan $1,500. At the time Buddy was sharing office space with a surveyor by the name of Mr. Carolina.</p>\n    <p id=\"b466-5\">According to the testimony of Buddy Lujan, Maria Mendiola came to him in 1965 and asked him if he wanted to buy 2 hectares of land for $2,000. He agreed and she gave him the deed. He wrote in the lot number 5243-1-2 because he saw that lot number on a map prepared by Mr. Carolina; however, he does not know where that map is or where Mr. Carolina is. No mention was ever made of a survey, and he has no knowledge of a survey. According to Buddy, the verbal contract was a contract only for the purchase of land.</p>\n    <p id=\"b466-6\">FINDING OF TRIAL COURT</p>\n    <p id=\"b466-7\">The trial court concluded that the plaintiff should have and recover from the defendants 20,532.95 square meters of land located in the southeastern portion of basic Lot No. 5243. (There was evidence that the 2 hectares which Maria intended to transfer to plaintiff was in the southeastern portion of her land. This was oral evidence presented by Pedro Mendiola and Buddy Lujan.)</p>\n    <p id=\"b466-8\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n    <p id=\"b466-9\">Appellants contend that the trial court committed error by admitting the deed into evidence, and that the trial court should have declared the deed to be of no effect and void since the description of the land in the deed is not complete.</p>\n    <p id=\"b466-10\">DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD BE REVERSED</p>\n    <p id=\"b466-11\">Appellants have pointed to two California cases which are directly on point, <em>Saterstrom v. Glick Bros. Sash, Door, &amp; Mill Co., </em>5 P.2d 21 (District Court of Appeal, California, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>1931), and <em>Scott v. Woodworth, </em>167 P. 543 (District Court of Appeal, California, 1917). Both cases involved a quiet title action. The sole basis of the quiet title action in both cases was a deed. In both cases, the deed was held not to adequately define the land conveyed. In <em>Scott, </em>the description contained everything except a westerly boundary. The court held that the deed description was too vague to locate the property and was of no effect:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b467-3\">To be valid on its face, a deed must contain such a description of the real-property thereby intended to be conveyed as will enable the property to be readily located by reference to the description. It is true that the description by boundaries may be ambiguous or indefinite, and still the deed sufficient if it otherwise provides means whereby the description can be made certain and the land identified and located. Where, however, the description is so vague or uncertain that the property cannot be identified and located therefrom, and the writing itself does not furnish the means whereby the description may be made sufficiently definite and certain readily to locate the property, then the instrument must be held void, since the imperfections of the description cannot be supplied through evidence extrinsic to the writing itself without running up against the positive mandate of the rule that a conveyance of real property must be in writing....</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b467-4\">In <em>Saterstrom, </em>the description of the property to be conveyed was accurate and complete except for the fact that the name of the county in which the property was located was accidentally omitted. Again, the court struck down the deed, held it void and refused to quiet title in the hands of the plaintiff. The court did not allow any use of extrinsic evidence to show in what county the property was located.</p>\n    <p id=\"b467-5\">Perhaps, plaintiff should have brought an action for specific performance or to reform a deed but he did not.</p>\n    <p id=\"b467-6\">The decision of the trial court is hereby reversed and the deed in question is declared void and of no effect. The case is further remanded to the Superior Court with directions to enter judgment against defendants in the amount of $2,000.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The two petitions were filed in Probate Case No. 39-70, In the Matter of the Estate of Ignacia Babauta Chargualaf, aka Ignacia Chargualaf Espinosa, and in Land Registration Case No. 18-71, In the Matter of the Application of Joaquin T. Espinosa and Tatsue Espinosa, Husband and Wife, for the registration of a parcel of land designated as Lot No. 264, Municipality of Merizo, Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b460-8\">FACTS</p>\n    <p id=\"b460-9\">Ignacia Babauta Chargualaf died sometime in 1944. On May 27, 1970, Domingo T. Espinosa filed a Petition for Letters of Administration. The heirs of Ignacia were listed as:</p>\n    <p id=\"b460-10\">Carmen C. Manalisay, daughter;</p>\n    <p id=\"b460-11\">Pedro C. Espinosa, son (deceased) ;</p>\n    <p id=\"b460-12\">Domingo T. Espinosa, grandson (son of Pedro);</p>\n    <p id=\"b460-13\">Rosa E. Lujan, granddaughter (daughter of Pedro); and</p>\n    <p id=\"b460-14\">Joaquin T. Espinosa, grandson (son of Pedro).</p>\n    <p id=\"b460-15\">On November 18, 1970, Judge Benson, sitting as a judge of the Island Court of Guam, granted a Decree of Final Distribution which distributed all of Ignacia\u2019s property, namely Lot No. 264, Merizo, to Joaquin T. Espinosa and his wife, Tatsue Espinosa. The distribution was made on the basis that on May 25,1970, all of the other heirs waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>their interest in the estate in favor of Joaquin and Tatsue Espinosa. That Carmen Manalisay signed such a waiver is an admitted fact.</p>\n    <p id=\"b461-3\">On February 16,1971, the Espinosas filed a Land Registration Petition in the Island Court of Guam for the registration of Lot No. 264. On March 19, 1971, Carmen Manalisay filed an entry of appearance and an opposition to the Land Registration Petition. On May 26, 1971, Judge Vicente Reyes entered a Decree Establishing Title in the names of the Espinosas.</p>\n    <p id=\"b461-4\">On May 10,1971, Manalisay filed a Petition to Set Aside Waiver and Decree of Distribution in the Probate Case. It does not appear from the record that Manalisay ever filed a petition to set aside the Land Registration Decree. The Petition came before Judge Benson for hearing on May 22-23, 1974. At the beginning of the hearing, the proceeding was classified by the court clerk and counsel for Manalisay as a \u201chearing on a petition to set aside the decree of distribution and the decree of registration of title in the respective cases\u201d. Both Manalisay and the Espinosas were represented at the hearing. The hearing resulted in a decision by Judge Benson denying the petition to set aside the decree of distribution and granting the petition to set aside the Decree Establishing Title in the Land Registration case.</p>\n    <p id=\"b461-5\">The only matter on appeal is the denial by Judge Benson of the Petition to set aside the Decree of Distribution in the Probate Case.</p>\n    <p id=\"b461-6\">TRIAL COURT HAD NO JURISDICTION TO ENTERTAIN PETITION</p>\n    <p id=\"b461-7\">Appellant attempted to overturn and repeal the Decree of Final Distribution in the Probate Court. Unfortunately, appellant\u2019s avenue was ill chosen. The decree of distribution entered by the Island Court on November 18, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>1970, was a final order, and the Island Court had no power to revoke its order. Appellant\u2019s proper remedy would be to collaterally attack the decree of distribution in an equitable action for the purpose of impressing a constructive trust upon Lot No. 264. A case directly on point is <em>Hewett v. Linstead, 122 </em>P.2d 352, District Court of Appeal, California (1942). In <em>Hewett, </em>the plaintiffs were heirs who had not been listed in the Petition for Letters of Administration and were not included in the Decree of Distribution. They attacked the Decree in an equitable action to impress a constructive trust on the ground that the Decree of Distribution had been obtained either by mistake or fraud on the ground that they had either been inadvertently or intentionally left out of the proceeding by the petitioning heirs.</p>\n    <p id=\"b462-5\">The Island Court had no jurisdiction to hear an equitable action to enforce a constructive trust on real property, since it was a court of limited jurisdiction and did not have equity jurisdiction for such purpose. Guam Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 83. At the time these proceedings took place, the only court in Guam with such jurisdiction was the District Court of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b462-6\">FINDINGS OF TRIAL COURT</p>\n    <p id=\"b462-7\">Even if the Island Court had had jurisdiction to entertain the petition, this court would not reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b462-8\">The decision of the trial court established the following finding:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b462-9\">The court further finds that there was lack of evidence introduced by Carmen C. Manalisay to set aside the waiver and decree settling final account of administrator and final distribution entered by this court on November 18, 1970, whereby said property was distributed to Joaquin T. Espinosa and Tatsue Espinosa, husband and wife.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b463-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Mrs. Manalisay contended that the final decree of distribution was granted on the ground that she had signed a waiver waiving any interest in the Estate of Ignacia B. Chargualaf to appellees, Joaquin and Tatsue Espinosa. Mrs. Manalisay admits signing the waiver but contended that her signature was obtained by fraud committed by the appellees. More specifically, Mrs. Manalisay claims that appellee, Joaquin Espinosa, her nephew, represented to her that she was only giving him permission to build a house on her land and that she was not waiving her interest in the land to him.</p>\n    <p id=\"b463-3\">The trial court found a lack of evidence to set aside the waiver. The record reflects ample evidence to support the finding of the trial court that no fraud was committed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b463-4\">When the findings and judgment of the trial court are not against the clear weight of the evidence, the appellate court will not overturn the findings of the trial court. <em>In re Paull\u2019s Estate, </em>254 P.2d 357 (Supreme Court of Oklahoma, 1950).</p>\n    <p id=\"b463-5\">CASE SHOULD BE REMANDED</p>\n    <p id=\"b463-6\">In situations where a lower court was without jurisdiction to entertain the action in question, and that fact was not raised by the parties, the Appellate Court may notice the defect. While the Appellate Court does not have jurisdiction of the merits, it does have jurisdiction to correct the error of the lower court in entertaining the action. <em>United States v. Corrick, </em>298 U.S. 435 (1936).</p>\n    <p id=\"b463-7\">The case is remanded to the trial court with directions to dismiss the petition to set aside the final decree of distribution in Probate Case No. 39-70.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

On December 12, 1975, the defendant was convicted as charged in the indictment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b494-5\">Defendant\u2019s first contention that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict is without merit.</p>\n    <p id=\"b494-6\">Defendant next argues that the trial court gave an erroneous jury instruction regarding entrapment. The trial court gave a proper instruction on the theory of entrapment (taken from CAL-JIC 4.60). (RT 178.) It is true that the trial court failed to take the language of an additional instruction verbatim from CAL-JIC 4.61 (dealing with whether furnishing the opportunity to commit a crime is entrapment). However, the court on appeal is satisfied that the trial judge accurately stated the law and therefore the jury could not have been confused by this. If defendant had any objection to the entrapment instruction, he should have made it at trial.</p>\n    <p id=\"b494-7\">Defendant also urges that certain hearsay statements should have been excluded, but he made no objection to these statements at trial. Clearly, a proper objection must have been made at trial. Witkin, California Evidence 2d 1207, <em>People v. Moore, </em>91 CR 538, 13 Cal.App.2d 424 (1970).</p>\n    <p id=\"b494-8\">Finally, defendant was brought to trial within five months after he was indicted. The record does not show that any prejudice resulted from this delay. Under these circumstances the delay is not of constitutional proportion and does not warrant reversal.

However, the appellant has incorrectly based his appeal on \u00a7 325 of the Guam Code of Civil Procedure, when the applicable section is \u00a7 323 which properly deals with adverse possession under a written instrument or judgment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b482-12\">Clearly, the petitioners-appellees based their claim to Lot 87-A on a written instrument, namely a May 23, 1932, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>deed. (Transcript, pages 5:8 to 7:24.) Section 323 of the Guam Code is therefore clearly applicable and it sets forth the following requirements:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b483-3\">\u00a7 323. What constitutes adverse possession under written instrument or judgment. For the purpose of constituting an adverse possession, by any person claiming a title founded upon a written instrument or a judgment or decree, land is deemed to have been possessed and occupied in the following cases:</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b483-4\">1. Where it has been usually cultivated or improved;</p>\n    <p id=\"b483-5\">2. Where it has been protected by a substantial enclosure;</p>\n    <p id=\"b483-6\">3. Where, although not enclosed, it has been used for the supply of fuel, or of fencing timber for the purposes of husbandry, or for pasturage, or for the ordinary use of the occupant;</p>\n    <p id=\"b483-7\">4. Where a known farm or single lot has been partly improved, the portion of such farm or lot that may have been left not cleared, or not enclosed according to the usual course and custom of the adjoining country, shall be deemed to have been occupied for the same length of time as the part improved and cultivated. [Enacted 1953.]</p>\n    <p id=\"b483-8\">Sufficient evidence was offered at trial for the court to have reasonably concluded that these requirements for adverse possession had been satisfied by the petitionersappellees. During the years 1955 to 1961, the petitioner visited Guam at least once a year, while in active service. During these visits he cleared the land, gathered coconuts and gave people permission to use the property. (Transcript, pages 9:15 to 12:10.) He paid taxes on the land in question for 5 consecutive years. (Transcript, pages 7:24 to 9:14.) Since 1972 petitioner has been staying on the area of Lots 87 and 87-A and has cleaned the entire area and has granted people permission to picnic there. (Transcript, pages 15:3 to 16.) Furthermore, he gave the Democratic Party permission to use a shelter on Lot 87-A in the early part of 1974. (Transcript, page 16.) While perhaps another court might have reached a contrary finding, sufficient evidence was offered to suggest that Lot 87-A had been improved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>and that possession was adverse. It is true that under \u00a7 325, as appellant argues, the requirements for adverse possession would not have been satisfied here. However, petitioner testified that he had become the owner of Lots 87 and 87-A through his mother, who had traced her interest through the May 23, 1932, deed which petitioner introduced as his first exhibit. Clearly, petitioner was attempting to base his claim on this written instrument and \u00a7 323 (rather than \u00a7 325) of the Guam Code of Civil Procedure applies.</p>\n    <p id=\"b484-5\">Appellee cites from 2 Cal.Jur.2d 538-539, which in discussing the California counterpart to \u00a7 323 of the Guam Code, gives the following rule:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b484-6\">The showing required by an adverse claimant under color of title is less exacting in its character than is required where only possession must be depended upon. Where the claim is founded upon a written instrument, judgment, or decree, the land is deemed to have been possessed and occupied not only where it has been actually cultivated and improved, or where it has been protected by a substantial inclosure, but where, although not inclosed, it has been used for the supply of fuel, or of fencing timber for the purposes of husbandry, or for pasturage, <em>or for the ordinary use of the occupant. </em>(Emphasis added.) In addition, where a known farm or single lot has been partly improved, the portion of such farm or lot that may have been left uncleared or uninclosed according to the usual course and custom of the adjoining country is deemed to have been occupied for the same length of time as the part improved and cultivated.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b484-7\">Identical language can be found in 2 Cal. Jur.3d at pages 684-685, and the petitioner could make a less exact showing of adverse possession when he introduced the 1932 deed to prove his case under color of title. (Exhibit #1.) Sufficient evidence was introduced to support the trial judge\u2019s findings and consequentially they should not be disturbed on appeal.</p>\n    <p id=\"b484-8\">While we affirm the trial judge\u2019s findings as to adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>possession, we must remand the case to Superior Court for further determination as to \u201can accurate description of the land\u201d, as required by Guam Civil Code, \u00a7 1157.14. Incomplete evidence was offered at trial as to the metes and bounds of Lot 87-A, and while the trial judge ordered that a Territorial Survey be done, the last paper transmitted on appeal shows that the territorial surveyor filed a motion asking for a sixty-day extension of time. Since the Department of Land Management must rely on the decree of the trial court with regard to Lot 87-A, all the requirements of \u00a7 1157.14 must be satisfied before such a decree can be given final effect. Affirmed in part. Remanded in part.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

He was convicted of first degree murder, burglary, and assault with a deadly weapon. He was sentenced on these crimes to life, 15, and 10 years, respectively, all sentences to run concurrently. The evidence indicates that Francisco was the driver of the \u201cget-away\u201d car. His accomplices, David R. Sab\u00edan and Frankie Q. Aguon, entered the victim\u2019s dwelling, and Aguon fired the shots that killed Joseph G. Sab\u00edan and wounded a baby, Laura Jean Sab\u00edan.</p>\n    <p id=\"b520-9\">The law of Guam provides:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b520-10\">Guam Penal Code \u00a7 189. <em>Degrees of Murder.</em></blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b520-11\">All murder which, is perpetrated by means of poison, or lying in wait, torture or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing; or which is committed in the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate arson, rape, robbery, burglary, mayhem or kidnapping is murder of the first degree; and all other kinds of murder are of the second degree.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b520-12\">Guam Penal Code \u00a7 190. <em>Punishment for Murder.</em></blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b520-13\">Every person guilty of murder in the first degree shall suffer confinement in prison for life; and every person guilty of murder in the second degree is punishable by imprisonment from 5 years to life.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b520-14\">Francisco contends that this mandatory life sentence, as applied to one in his situation, constitutes cruel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>and unusual punishment. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in a recent case, considered the question and held the Guam statute applied here to be constitutional. <em>Guam v. Root, </em>524 F.2d 195 (9th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1076 (1976). Defendant cites cases to the contrary and law review articles which are critical, but the rule established by <em>Guam v. Root </em>governs. Neither the cases of <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153 (1976), and <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238 (1972), which deal with the death penalty, nor the language in them, in our opinion, warrant a conclusion that <em>Guam v. Root </em>is not now controlling in the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n    <p id=\"b521-3\">Aguon, who fired the fatal shots, was, by virtue of a plea bargain made after Francisco\u2019s conviction, permitted to plead guilty to second degree murder and was sentenced to 20 years.</p>\n    <p id=\"b521-4\">It is now argued that it has been judicially determined that the underlying crime was murder in the second degree; that, hence, Francisco could not be guilty of first degree murder; and that, in any event, the judgments are inconsistent. The fact is that there was a burglary in which Francisco participated, a person was killed in the course of the burglary, and Francisco was guilty of a felony murder. The apparent inconsistency lies in the treatment of Aguon. That treatment was not the result of the law operating upon a given set of facts. It was the result of a compromise. In plea bargaining, a plea, illogical in view of the facts, may be accepted in order to close a case without a trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is recognized that the punishments imposed as a result of plea bargaining justifiably may be less than those imposed where the trial process is allowed to run its full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>course.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For that reason alone, a sentence imposed as a result of a plea bargain cannot be compared with a sentence imposed as a result of a trial and a finding of guilty.</p>\n    <p id=\"b522-5\">The judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n      <p id=\"b521-5\"> \u201cCharge and sentence concessions may be utilized to aid in ensuring the prompt and certain application of correctional measures to the defendant for rehabilitative purposes.\u201d <em>Kansas v. Byrd, </em>203 Kan. 45, 453 P.2d 22, 28 (1969).</p>\n    </footnote>\n    <footnote label=\"2\">\n      <p id=\"b522-13\"> See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 (Advisory Comm. Note to 1974 Amendment). Traditionally, in civil cases, the courts have been wary of admitting offers of compromise for the purpose of proving that a person did or did not do a given act. A party making an offer may do no more than make an offer to buy peace. <em>Moore v. Stetson Machine Works, </em>110 Wash. 649, 188 P. 769 (1920); 2 Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 1061 (2d ed. 1923). The state, in view of the necessity of disposing of criminal cases other than by trial (see Advisory Comm. Note, supra), does not, by accepting a plea to a lesser offense, admit (except for the purposes of the instant case) that a more serious offense was not committed; nor does a judge, in approving such a concession, adjudicate (except for purposes of the instant ease) the degree of crime of which the defendant was actually guilty.</p>\n    </footnote>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

There the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given in English. Following defendant\u2019s signing of a waiver-of-rights form, defendant was interrogated, and he then confessed. Defendant\u2019s first language is Tagalog, and it is now claimed that the confession was not voluntary because defendant did not comprehend the warnings given to him in English. At the suppression hearing a school psychologist who had examined defendant testified that his verbal IQ was 64 \u2014 just above mental retardation; that his reading comprehension was between first and second grade levels; and that he could not possibly comprehend the <em>Miranda </em>rights form in the English language. The detectives who questioned defendant testified that the defendant said that he understood English and that they believed he understood. A fact question as to whether defendant knowingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>waived his rights was presented to the judge, and it is not clear that the judge ever resolved the question.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n    <p id=\"b517-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><em>Jackson v. Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368 (1964), establishes a rule that a defendant in a criminal case has a 14th amendment right to have the voluntariness of his confession determined by the court, and <em>Sims v. Georgia, </em>385 U.S. 538, 544 (1967), establishes the proposition that \u201c[although the judge need not make formal findings of fact or write an opinion, his conclusion that the confession is voluntary must appear from the record with unmistakable clarity.\u201d</p>\n    <p id=\"b517-3\">We are unable to determine that the judge here made such a finding. He was clearly mistaken in saying that the confession was not the result of interrogation, and apparently the conclusion that the confession was voluntary was based on that mistaken premise rather than on a determination that the defendant fully understood the warnings given. In any event, it does not appear with unmistakable clarity that the trial court ever passed upon defendant\u2019s understanding of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings given to him in English. For that reason, the judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n    <p id=\"b517-4\">On a new trial, the contention made by the defendant that his confession was the fruit of the poisoned tree may be important, and for that reason we rule upon it. It is urged that defendant\u2019s arrest was based solely on information received from an unidentified informer<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who was not known to be reliable, and that, hence, the confession was the product of an unlawful arrest and is inadmissible. See <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471 (1963). In this case, the officers knew that the tires had been stolen; they knew that the informer had pointed to defendant and one Marquez. Marquez, on being arrested, confessed, and in his confession implicated defendant. Marquez\u2019 confession verified the statements of the informer, at least to the extent that it showed the informer to be correct about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Marquez, and constituted another source pointing to defendant. Under these circumstances, we believe that there was probable cause to arrest defendant and that his confession was not the product of an unlawful arrest unless it can be said that the information given by Marquez could not be used because Marquez was unlawfully arrested and his statements were the fruit of the poisoned tree and not usable against defendant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b518-5\">We assume that the arrest of Marquez was unlawful and that his confession, as against him, was inadmissible. <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471 (1963). Plaintiff, however, has no standing to assert the illegality of the Marquez arrest. In <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>the officers illegally arrested one Toy. His statements secured as the result of the illegal arrest were inadmissible against him, as was some heroin found as a result of Toy\u2019s statements. However, the heroin was admissible as to Wong Sun. The Court said at 492 \u201c[t]he seizure of this heroin invaded no right of privacy of person or premises which would entitle Wong Sun to object to its use at his trial.\u201d The fact that the heroin was the fruit of the poisoned tree as to Toy did not preclude its use as to Wong Sun. In <em>Wong Sun, </em>the Court applied to a case involving an illegal arrest the normal rule that only one whose rights have been violated has standing to complain. See <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 488 (1976) (stating the rule that standing to invoke the exclusionary rule exists only when the Government attempts to use illegally obtained evidence to incriminate the victim of the illegal <em>search); Alderman v. United States, 394 </em>U.S. 165 (1969) (holding that suppression of evidence derived from illegal electronic surveillance can be successfully urged only by those whose rights were violated by the search itself, not by those who are aggrieved by the introduction of damaging evidence); <em>Goldstein v. United States, </em>316 U.S. 114 (1942) (holding that one who was not a party to messages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>intercepted in violation of \u00a7 605 of the Federal Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605, has no standing to object to the introduction of the messages into evidence).</p>\n    <p id=\"b519-3\">The cause is reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n      <p id=\"b516-5\"> The colloquy between court and counsel was as follows:</p>\n      <blockquote id=\"b516-6\">THE COURT: Thank you. As to the three points, I think that the arrest took place at the Reyes home. He was taken into custody at that time. At that time, the Public Safety had probably cause to arrest him.

I\u2019m saying that his statement that the Government intends to produce there \u2014 the testimony was without contradiction that it was not the fruit of questioning by the police.</blockquote>\n      <blockquote id=\"b516-15\">MR. KERLEY: May I ask further if the Court is ruling that, uh, the fact situation we have before us, that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required ?</blockquote>\n      <blockquote id=\"b516-16\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t have to rule on that.

The basic issue to be determined is whether Public Law 12-173, the Independent Special Prosecutor Act of 1974, is in conflict with the Organic Act of Guam. After a review of the points and authorities submitted, all of the grounds except one can be summarily dealt with.</p>\n    <p id=\"b532-10\">The defendants assert that Public Law 12-173 is a Bill of Attainder and therefore violates 48 U.S.C. Sec. 1421b(j) and the United States Constitution, Article I, Section 10. It is clear that all the elements necessary to find a bill of attainder are not present. The defendants may be an ascertainable class and Public Law 12-173 may recite sufficient activities deemed reprehensible but there is no declaration of guilt, or imposition of legislative judgment and verdict or a prescription of punishment. In short, there has been no trial by Legislature.</p>\n    <p id=\"b532-11\">The defendants next argue that this Court does not exist pursuant to <em>Agana Bay Development Company (Hong Kong) Ltd. v. Supreme Court of Guam, </em>Civil Case No. 74-177.</p>\n    <p id=\"b532-12\">This Court, at the hearing on August 23,1975, made its position clear. The Supreme Court of Guam is not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>appellate court for the purpose of this hearing. The effect of the <em>Agana Bay </em>case, supra, is limited by the decision of Judge Curtis, United States District Judge, in his opinion in Civil Case 75-049, <em>Sanchez, et al. v. Supreme Court of Guam. </em>See also <em>Look v. Government of Guam, </em>497 F.2d 669, 700 (9th Cir. 1974).</p>\n    <p id=\"b533-3\">Thirdly, the defendants claim the Chief Judge of the Superior Court abused his discretion in the appointment of Mr. St. Pierre as Special Prosecutor.. Since no testimony was taken and counsel for the defendants have not advanced this ground further, there is nothing upon which this Court can determine one way or the other whether this argument has merit.</p>\n    <p id=\"b533-4\">Of major concern to the Court is whether the Special Prosecutor Act, Public Law 12-173, violates the basic concept of the separation of powers and therefore violates the Organic Act of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b533-5\">The pertinent provisions of the law challenged by the defendants are the following:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b533-6\">A Special Prosecutor independent of the Executive Branch of government should be properly appointed by the Judicial Branch of government, and Section 6 of the Organic Act of Guam (Chapter 8A, Title 48, U.S.C.A.) provides authority for the Legislature to vest such appointment other than in the Governor of Guam. Public Law 12-173, Section 2(d).</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b533-7\">The establishment of an independent Special Prosecutor is an appropriate exercise by the Legislature of the power under Section 11 of the Organic Act of Guam which extends to \u201call subjects of local application\u201d in that all such activities are alleged to have occurred in Guam. Public Law 12-173, Section 2(e).</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b533-8\">The Chief Judge of the Superior Court of Guam is authorized and directed to appoint a Special Prosecutor and a Deputy Special Prosecutor with the experience, abilities and reputation necessary to perform the responsibilities in these offices who shall have the duties and powers prescribed by this Act.

Sec. 1423(a).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b534-14\">It is clear, indeed uncontested, that the Organic Act of Guam does establish the traditional three branches of government and the concept of separation of powers.</p>\n    <p id=\"b535-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Both the Special Prosecutor and the defendants agree that prosecution is an executive function. <em>United States v. Nixon, </em>94 S.Ct. 3090.</p>\n    <p id=\"b535-3\">The Special Prosecutor argues that if the Legislative Branch does not have the power to authorize .and direct a member of the Judicial Branch to appoint a prosecutor \u201cor for that matter, any other executive officer,\u201d then the judiciary would have no power to appoint any judicial or nonjudicial officer and therefore the courts could not operate. The Special Prosecutor then relies upon \u00a7 1422 of the Organic Act to support the conclusion that the Act allows the Legislative Branch to appoint officers and employees of the Executive Branch.</p>\n    <p id=\"b535-4\">The first matter which must be decided is whether the vesting of the appointment of the Special Prosecutor in a court is a valid exercise of the legislative power of the Guam Legislature.</p>\n    <p id=\"b535-5\">The same issue confronted the United States House of Representatives when it considered House Resolution 11401 which would have appointed a three judge panel to appoint a Special Prosecutor for the so-called \u201cWatergate affair\u201d. Legal scholars as well as members of the House of Representatives differed as to the constitutionality of such an appointment. The U.S. House of Representatives did not pass House Resolution 11401 and solved the problem in another manner and was able to avoid the problem of the validity of such an appointment. The Court in <em>Nader v. Bork, </em>366 F.Supp. 104 (D.C. 1973), deplored the suggestion of the appointment of a Special Prosecutor by the courts at page 109 but no final judicial determination was made as to its validity.</p>\n    <p id=\"b535-6\">There are two basic differences between the United States Constitution and the Organic Act of Guam in relation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the power of the Legislative Branch to appoint Executive Branch officials.</p>\n    <p id=\"b536-5\">First, Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution provides:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b536-6\">He [the President] shall have power by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointment are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law; <em>but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b536-7\">For appointment to the Executive Branch by someone other than the Governor, the Special Prosecutor relies on 48 U.S.C. Sec. 1422 which does not have comparable provisions as emphasized above and specifically does not vest appointment power in the courts of law.</p>\n    <p id=\"b536-8\">Secondly, the doctrine of separation of powers has developed by case law and interpretation of the United States Constitution. It does not specifically set up the three branches of Government. However, the Organic Act of Guam, in 48 U.S.C. Sec. 1421a, does this.</p>\n    <p id=\"b536-9\">By reading the Organic Act of Guam in its entirety and comparing it with the United States Constitution, the conclusion is inescapable that the Guam Legislature is more limited in Executive Branch appointments than that reserved to the United States Congress. Not only does the Organic Act specifically establish the three branches, but it also spells out the power of the Governor as head of the Executive Branch. If one was to conclude from 48 U.S.C. 1422 and 1422(a) that the Guam Legislature had unlimited rights of appointment and removal of Executive Branch officers and employees, the entire concept of separation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>powers and the authority granted the Governor would be meaningless. 48 U.S.C. 1423(a) makes it clear that the Legislative Branch does not have that unlimited right of appointment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b537-3\">Therefore, this Court must look to the specifics of Public Law 12-173 and apply the Organic Act of Guam with all the significance and reasoning for the separation of powers in mind.</p>\n    <p id=\"b537-4\">One of the earliest United States Supreme Court cases dealing with the appointment of executive officials by courts of law is <em>Ex parte Siebold, </em>100 U.S. 371 (1879). The court sustained the appointment of supervisors of congressional elections by judges, pursuant to legislation enacted by the United States Congress. The Court discussed the application of Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution. Even though this clause provided clear authority for the Legislative Branch to vest the appointment of executive officers in the courts of law, the court considered whether the Legislative Branch had the power to impose on the courts the appointments.</p>\n    <p id=\"b537-5\">The Court stated:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b537-6\">It is no doubt usual and proper to vest the appointment of inferior officers in that department of the government, executive or judicial, or in that particular executive department to which the duties of such officers appertain.... But as the Constitution stands, the selection of the appointing power ... is a matter resting in the discretion of Congress.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b537-7\">In discussing some older cases where the courts declined to exercise certain duties imposed by Congress, the Court stated:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b537-8\">The law of 1792 which required the circuit courts to examine claims to revolutionary pensions, and the law of 1849, authorizing the district judge of Florida to examine and adjudicate upon claims for injuries suffered by the inhabitants of Florida from the American army in 1812, were rightfully held to impose upon the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>powers not judicial, and were therefore, void. But the duty to appoint inferior officers, when required thereto by law, is a constitutional duty of the courts; and in the present case there is no such incongruity in the duty required as to excuse the courts from its performance, or to render their acts void. It cannot be affirmed that the appointment of the officers in question could, with any greater propriety, and certainly not with equal regard to convenience, have been assigned to any other depositary of official power capable of exercising it. Neither the President, nor any head of department, could have been equally competent to the task.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b538-5\">At first blush one may consider <em>Siebold </em>as authority for the appointment of a special prosecutor by the courts. However, the \u201cincongruity\u201d which concerned the United States Supreme Court also concerns this Court when considering the express establishment of the three branches of Government (Sec. 1421a), the vesting of the executive power in the Governor and that \u201cHe shall be responsible for the faithful execution of the laws of Guam and the laws of the United States applicable in Guam.\u201d (From Sec. 1422)</p>\n    <p id=\"b538-6\">As pointed out in <em>United States v. </em>Cox, 342 F.2d 167 (1965), a prosecutor acts as an agent of the executive in carrying out the executive\u2019s constitutional duty of enforcement of the laws.</p>\n    <p id=\"b538-7\">The normal way by which an executive officer is designated is by executive appointment. Once the appointment is vested in the courts it is suspect. Public Law 12-173 not only vests the appointment power in the Chief Judge of the Superior Court of Guam but it also states that the Chief Judge shall establish the salaries for the appointees (Special Prosecutor and the Deputy Special Prosecutor). The Chief Judge shall fill any vacancy and pursuant to Section 12, the Chief Judge of the Superior Court has the sole and exclusive power to dismiss the Special Prosecutor.</p>\n    <p id=\"b538-8\">It must be noted that none of the statutes considered in the cases referred to herein, which deal with the appoint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>ment of executive officials by the Judiciary, approach the scope and authority of Public Law 12-173.</p>\n    <p id=\"b539-3\">One does not need to ponder long on how the Legislative Branch could effectively decimate the Executive Branch by designating a member of the Judicial Branch with the powers given in Public Law 12-173. If a judge is given the power to appoint and remove executive officials along with the power to establish the salaries from funds appropriated by the Legislature, the Legislature then could reduce the funds appropriated for the Executive Branch and divert the funds to the judicially appointed officials.</p>\n    <p id=\"b539-4\">Support for Public Law 12-173 cannot be found in using the examples cited by the Special Prosecutor. It is true that 28 U.S.C. 546 provides for the appointment by the courts of United States attorneys. The statute was sustained in <em>United States v. Solomon, </em>216 F.Supp. 835 (S.D.N.Y. 1963), but the power given to the District Courts by the law is only an interim one to fill any vacancy in the office. The President, by filling the vacancy, can divest the appointee of his job. In addition, the President is empowered instantly to remove any United States attorney whom the court may appoint. <em>Solomon, </em>supra at page 843.</p>\n    <p id=\"b539-5\">28 U.S.C. 565 provides for the appointment by the courts of the United States marshals. Once again this is to temporarily fill a post which is vacant until the vacancy is filled permanently. <em>Siebold, </em>supra at page 397.</p>\n    <p id=\"b539-6\">Under the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, as amended (78 Stat. 552,18 U.S.C. 3006A), the courts appoint defense counsel for a particular case where the defendant cannot afford counsel. A review of Subsection (b) of \u00a7 3006A demonstrates the great difference in the appointment process there and the one provided for in Public Law 12-173. 18 U.S.C. 3006A simply cannot be used as support for Public Law 12-173.</p>\n    <p id=\"b539-7\">The appointment of defense counsel on a case by case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>basis by the court is far removed from the appointment of a prosecutor who serves for a term of at least a year, whose salary is fixed by the court and whose removal and discharge is vested in the court. The ethical problem of such a prosecutor appearing in the appointing judge\u2019s court is obvious.</p>\n    <p id=\"b540-5\">Another problem exists with Public Law 12-178. The Court must look to what the appointee does and what his function is, even assuming he is properly appointed. An appointment by itself may not violate the separation of powers doctrine but once the appointee begins to function, there may be such a violation unless there is some authority to authorize the activity.</p>\n    <p id=\"b540-6\">In the case of <em>United States v. Nixon, </em>supra, a Special Prosecutor represented the Government. Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution authorizes Congress to vest in the Attorney General the power to conduct the criminal litigation of the United States Government. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 516. Congress also vested in the Attorney General the power to appoint subordinate officers to assist him in the discharge of his duties. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 509, 510, 515, 533. Pursuant thereto, the Attorney General delegated the authority to represent the United States in the Watergate matter to a Special Prosecutor.</p>\n    <p id=\"b540-7\">Thus, in the Watergate Special Prosecutor cases, a clear line of authority traceable to the Constitution of the United States is evident, whereby the Special Prosecutor could support his existence and activity from the Legislative Branch. In other words, the appointment of the Special Prosecutor was proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 533 and the activity to be engaged in, the prosecution of the cases, was authorized by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 516.</p>\n    <p id=\"b540-8\">As pointed out above, the Guam Organic Act does not have a provision similar to Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution. Rather, the Organic Act states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>that the Governor shall have general supervision and control of all departments and agencies of the Executive Branch (48 U.S.C. Sec. 1422) and he shall, except as otherwise provided in the Organic Act of the Laws of Guam, appoint all heads of the executive agencies and instrumentalities with the advice and consent of the Legislature. The issue then is whether the exception underlined above authorizes the appointment of the Special Prosecutor and the activities resulting therefrom.</p>\n    <p id=\"b541-3\">The legislative power extends to all subjects of legislation of local application not inconsistent with the provisions of the Organic Act. 48 U.S.C. Sec. 1423a.</p>\n    <p id=\"b541-4\">Public Law 12-173 prescribes the duties, powers and functions of the Special Prosecutor. Simply stated, he is to investigate and prosecute alleged crimes committed by certain persons. As stated in the Special Prosecutor\u2019s points and authorities in opposition to defendants\u2019 motion for dismissal, the Special Prosecutor is \u201cto invoke the criminal process as provided under the Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Organic Act.\u201d</p>\n    <p id=\"b541-5\">Therefore, it is clear that the Special Prosecutor is to perform the same or substantially similar activity as the Attorney General of Guam who is appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Legislature. Indeed, Public Law 12-173, Section 6(6), affirms this.</p>\n    <p id=\"b541-6\">At the same time that the Special Prosecutor is exercising his quasi Attorney General powers, he is declared to be independent of the Executive Branch (P.L. 12-173, Section 2(c) and (d)) and shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the offenses alleged to have been committed by the defendants. (P.L. 12-173, Section 5)</p>\n    <p id=\"b541-7\">Such a prosecutor cannot, consistent with the separation of powers doctrines, perform basic prosecutive functions such as signing indictments, granting immunity, trying cases in the courts and making other basic prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>tive judgments. The fact remains that the prosecution of offenses is a purely Executive Branch function that must be exercised by an official of that Branch. Legislative power, as distinguished from executive power, is the authority to make laws, but not to enforce- them or appoint the agents charged with the duty of such enforcement. The latter are executive functions. <em>Springer v. Philippine Islands, </em>277 U.S. 189, 202 (1928). See also <em>United States v. Cox, </em>supra, where the court stated that the United States attorney is an executive official of the Government and he exercises discretion whether there should be prosecution in a particular case. The court went on to say: \u201cIt follows as an incident of the constitutional separation of power, that the courts are not to interfere with the free exercise of the discretionary powers of the attorneys of the United States in their control over criminal prosecutions.\u201d</p>\n    <p id=\"b542-5\">The incongruity which the United States Supreme Court spoke about in <em>In re Siebold, </em>supra, is apparent.</p>\n    <p id=\"b542-6\">We therefore find that Public Law 12-173 is in violation of the Organic Act of Guam. Not only is the appointment process indicated therein invalid but the functions to be performed by the Special Prosecutor run afoul of the intent of the Organic Act. The doctrine of separation of powers has been violated.</p>\n    <p id=\"b542-7\">Since the indictments against the defendants are the fruit of the attempted usurpation of power by the Legislative Branch, they must fall from the improperly planted tree, Public Law 12-173.</p>\n    <p id=\"b542-8\">The indictments of the defendants shall be and the same are hereby dismissed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The taxi driver drove Duran to the residence of the defendant where the defendant agreed to have sexual intercourse with Duran in return for $50.00, which amount Duran paid to defendant. At this point Duran placed the defendant under arrest.</p>\n    <p id=\"b574-5\">It is clear from a reading of \u00a7\u00a7 28.15, 28.20 and 28.25 and the comments thereto that \u00a7 28.20(a) (1) does not render criminal the conduct of the defendant.</p>\n    <p id=\"b574-6\">If the place of the proposed act of prostitution had been a hotel room, the defendant\u2019s conduct might fall within \u00a7 28.15, which is a petty misdemeanor, or if the evidence before the grand jury showed repeated acts of prostitution by the defendant over a period of time such conduct might fall within \u00a7 28.20(a) (1).</p>\n    <p id=\"b574-7\">Therefore, the indictment must be dismissed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b574-8\">There is a further reason for the dismissal of the indictment. Section 28.20, under which defendant is charged, is a felony of the third degree which is punishable by a term not to exceed five (5) years. Prostitution under \u00a7 28.15 is punishable by a term not to exceed sixty (60) days.</p>\n    <p id=\"b574-9\">Even if defendant\u2019s conduct did constitute a violation of \u00a7 28.20(a), the facts herein presented fall within subsections (b) and (c) of \u00a7 7.67 of the Criminal and Correctional Code and justify dismissal by the Court of the indictment. It is inconceivable that the Legislature intended that defendant\u2019s conduct could be punished by as much as five years\u2019 imprisonment when the public solicitation prohibited by \u00a7 28.15 is limited to sixty (60) days, the latter being far more offensive than defendant\u2019s conduct. See Guam Law Revision Commission Report quoted by counsel for defendant on page 2 of his memorandum of law filed herein.</p>\n    <p id=\"b574-10\">Accordingly, it is ordered that the indictment herein be and the same hereby is dismissed. *</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Although petitioner argues that the warrant was illegal insofar as it was based on information supplied by an untested and undisclosed informant, the Court is of the opinion that this informant meets the two pronged standard established in the <em>Aguilar </em>line of cases.</p>\n    <p id=\"b338-7\">The first prong of \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d is clearly met both from the attached affidavit as well as the supporting, supplemental transcript.</p>\n    <p id=\"b338-8\">The second prong, reliability of informant, although not as clearly met as the first prong, is felt by the Court to meet the basic requirement of constitutional law. In this instance, the reliability of the informant is met by the independent corroboration of the informant\u2019s information by the police officers acting pursuant to the information given to them by this informant in the same fashion as occurred in the case of <em>State v. Marsden, </em>528 P.2d 1066. It should be noted here that in the <em>Marsden </em>case the setting was a warrantless arrest and here the search was conducted pursuant to a warrant. It has been held that in the latter setting less information is required than in the former, see <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 1509. Although same \u201cpoisoned fruits\u201d questions arise as to that portion of the informant\u2019s information which in essence was corroborated pursuant to an arrest which was subsequently determined to be illegal, the Court is of the opinion that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>instance is distinguishable from <em>Wong Sun v. U.S., </em>37 U.S. 471 inasmuch as the \u201ctainted\u201d information is not being used for probable cause purposes but rather for the purpose of corroborating an informant\u2019s information in relation to a determination of that informant\u2019s reliability.</p>\n    <p id=\"b339-3\">So ordered.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Duncan McCully appeared on behalf of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>ant Asan Blasting Co. and Edward Arriola represented the plaintiff Agat Boat Shop, Inc. The motion was heard before the Honorable Paul J. Abbate on May 24, 1979, and decision was reserved.</p>\n    <p id=\"b666-5\">The defendants seek a dismissal of Civil Case No. 380-78. That suit was filed against them by the plaintiff, Agat Boat Shop, Inc. The suit consists of two causes of action. In the first cause of action the plaintiff prays for $658,000 in general and punitive damages for the alleged intentional destruction of his property by the defendants. The plaintiff, in the second cause of action, prays for $54,000 in general and special damages plus costs of the suit for the alleged unlawful withholding, by the defendants, of the plaintiff\u2019s property.</p>\n    <p id=\"b666-6\">The defendants were assigned a judgment recovered by the assignor, Calvo Finance Corporation, against the Agat Boat Shop, Inc. (plaintiff in the present suit) in the Superior Court of Guam, Civil Case No. 922-77, for the sum of $16,020.00. Subsequently, a writ of execution was issued and the defendant (the highest bidder) purchased at an execution sale of the chose in action the present cause factors of the plaintiff for the sum of $6,000.00. Thereafter, defendants stipulated that the Court dismiss the cause of action.</p>\n    <p id=\"b666-7\">The general rule is that a chose in action may not be levied upon by a writ of execution. It is recognized, however, that a legislature may adopt statutes contra to the general rule. 30 Am.Jur. 2d 517-518.</p>\n    <p id=\"b666-8\">Guam has adopted the prior California \u00a7 688 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This Section, \u00a7 688 of Guam\u2019s Code of Civil Procedure, refers to property liable to execution. Since Guam courts have not made relevant interpretation of \u00a7 688 we turn to California\u2019s interpretation of its prior \u00a7 688 to determine whether a chose in action shall be subject to levy or sale on execution.</p>\n    <p id=\"b667-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>A revelant 1937 California case says that \u201cthe causes of action were things in action and were assignable and being personal property of a kind which was not specifically made exempt from execution, and also being not capable of manual delivery, they could be sold on execution under \u00a7 688 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d <em>Everts v. Fawcett (Will S.) Co., </em>24 C.A.2d 213, 74 P.2d 815 (1937).</p>\n    <p id=\"b667-3\">A later case, still under the prior \u00a7 688, which dealt with the same issue, also determined that a chose in action may be levied upon and sold on execution. <em>Mortimer v. Young, </em>53 C.A.2d 317, 127 P.2d 950 (1942).</p>\n    <p id=\"b667-4\">It is apparent that under California\u2019s prior \u00a7 688, upon which Guam\u2019s \u00a7 688 is based, a chose in action may be levied upon and sold on execution. Accordingly, the Court finds that the same interpretation be given to \u00a7 688 of Guam\u2019s Code of Civil Procedure. Moreover, \u00a7 691 (execution, service of writ) specifically refers to \u201cthings in action\u201d. As it was determined in <em>Everts </em>and <em>Mortimer, </em>a cause of action for tort is a thing in action. \u201cIt is therefore within the provision of \u00a7 691 of the Code of Civil Procedure (California and Guam\u2019s \u00a7 691 are identical) for the selling of the 'things in action\u2019 of the judgment debtor on execution.\u201d <em>Mortimer, </em>supra.</p>\n    <p id=\"b667-5\">For the aforementioned reasons, the defendants Motion for Dismissal is GRANTED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b667-6\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

After oral argument on appeal the late Eugene R. Gilmartin died, and the remaining judges constitute a quorum. These were petitions for the registration of land under the Land Title Registration Act of Guam. The Court below heard extensive testimony and made an on-the-site investigation. Based upon the testimony, exhibits and on-the-site investigation, the Court entered its decree of registration. The appellant in what was labeled a motion in the nature of a writ of error coram nobis moved to vacate each decree upon the ground that the Court was without authority to accept an abstract prepared by officials of the government of Guam and that the abstract recited but one instrument, a decree of distribution in Probate Estate No. 345-45. The Court very properly denied this motion, and the appellant appealed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b72-12\">We have examined the extensive record in these cases and we find no merit in any of the appellant\u2019s contentions on appeal. Except for the question of the abstract and its contents, all other questions involve those which properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>should have been raised in the lower Court. As regards the abstract, the sole contention is that it was prepared by employees of the government of Guam and that it shows nothing except an order of distribution of an estate. It was certainly* not the responsibility of the Court below to make independent inquiry as to the circumstances under which an abstract was prepared, nor was any showing made that there were additional entries which should have appeared upon the abstract.</p>\n    <p id=\"b73-3\">Other assignments of error on appeal relate to the method of conducting the Court, interpreting the testimony of witnesses and the preparation of the transcript by a court reporter who, it is alleged, does not understand the local dialect. The appellant was not represented by counsel, but the Court made every effort to see that he was familiar with the proceedings at all stages. Witnesses were presented by him. We find no evidence that he did not receive due process or that the decree of registration was not proper. We therefore affirm.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Petitioner filed a 23 September, 1974, complaint in the High Court of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands to compel Respondent. to pay support and alleging desertion commencing June 17, 1974. Respondent resides not in the Trust Territories, but in Guam, according to sworn allegations of Petitioner, who now asks the Superior Court of Guam to take jurisdiction over this case under Guam Civil Code I Section 1500 et seq. and to compel Respondent to pay $250.00 per month support for dependents.</p>\n    <p id=\"b393-13\">This Court could not possibly feel greater compassion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>for Petitioner\u2019s position or sympathy for Petitioner\u2019s public policy arguments. Indeed, we want to discourage estranged fathers escaping support obligations by fleeing from a Trust Territory to Guam. On Guam this Court has consistently dealt harshly with fathers in non-compliance with child support orders. Certainly reciprocity is the key to a system wherein Guam support orders will be mutually respected and enforced in the Trust Territories.</p>\n    <p id=\"b394-5\">Therefore, it is with sorrow and regret that this Court must deny Petitioner jurisdiction over Respondent under Guam Civil Code Section 1500 et seq. which applies only to sovereignties of the United States. The United Nations assigned the Trust Territories to the United States as trustee, not as sovereign. Although remedial acts are usually construed liberally, this Court cannot stretch the meaning of Section 1501(a) to cover this case. There is authority <em>(Callas v. U.S., </em>253 F.2d 838 (1958); <em>Brunnell v. U.S., </em>77 F.Supp. 68 (S.D.N.Y. 1948)) for considering Trust Territories more akin to \u201cforeign countries\u201d than sovereignties vis a vis the United States.</p>\n    <p id=\"b394-6\">The version of the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA) enacted in Guam in 1954 provides for enforcement of support decrees of other states, defining \u201cstate\u201d as:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b394-7\">Any state, territory, or possession of the United States and the District of Columbia in which this or a substantially similar reciprocal law has been enacted.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b394-8\">At present, then, Trust Territory support orders cannot be enforced in Guam Courts under URESA because the former are neither territories nor possessions of the United States. The future will likely see closer ties between the Trust. Territories and Guam as each enacts a new constitution drafted with, sensitivity to the need for cooperation and legal reciprocity. The world has changed' since, .1954.. and we: are hopeful - the' Fourteenth Guam <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Legislature will see the urgency of an amendment in URESA to include the Trust Territories, but it would be a judicial encroachment upon Guam Legislative prerogative' for this Court to rule today .in a manner inconsistent with the present law. The Guam Legislature chose not to include the Trust Territories when in 1954 URESA was enacted, nor has any Guam Legislature since then chosen to amend that statute, although it could easily have done so with clear express language like that contained in the Trust Territory URESA, 39 T.T.C. \u00a7 301 et seq. (Supp. 1973). Therefore, this Court is without justification for extending Guam\u2019s URESA beyond the sovereign jurisdiction of the United States.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Pugh, the appellant, hereinafter the defendant, was convicted of the offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, in violation of Section 23405(a) of the Government Code of Guam. The defendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the evidence was not sufficient to prove .the offense.</p>\n    <p id=\"b189-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>The evidence upon which the court below was entitled to rely showed that the defendant, who was known to the arresting officer, attracted the attention of the officer when he was seen standing by an automobile; that the officer became suspicious and when the automobile started up, followed it; that the automobile was weaving from one lane to the other lane on a two-lane highway; that the car was stopped, that the defendant\u2019s eyes were bloodshot; that there was vomit on his shirt and over the interior of the car, the rear floor and the front floor; that there was a brown paper bag which contained an almost empty bottle marked \u201cVodka\u201d; that when the defendant got out of the car he staggered; that the fly of his pants was open and that because of his general condition he was taken to jail. In our view this evidence was more than sufficient to prove the charge.</p>\n    <p id=\"b189-3\">While it is true that no sobriety test was given, this Court pointed out in <em>Marte v. Government of </em>Guam, 115 F.Supp. 524, (1953):</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b189-4\">It is true that many conditions of common experience give rise to opinions or conclusions that are treated as facts \u2014 the sum total of visual or other sensations may be quite a reliable indication of the facts.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b189-5\">In the <em>Marte </em>case we reversed because the arresting officers had not stated the facts leading to their conclusions and the doctor who gave the sobriety test did not make an examination, although he concluded that the defendant was drunk. In the present case we have the erratic driving of the defendant, bloodshot eyes, the vomit in the car and on the clothing of the defendant, the presence in the car of a bottle marked \u201cVodka\u201d, the failure of the defendant to fasten his pants, and his staggering condition.

FRANK RODNEY REYES, GORDON STEVE CLAY, Defendants</parties>\n  <docketnumber id=\"b267-4\">Criminal No. 5F-74</docketnumber>\n  <court id=\"AVh\">Superior Court of Guam</court>\n  <decisiondate id=\"b267-5\">September 26, 1974</decisiondate>\n  <opinion type=\"majority\">\n    <author id=\"b268-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>PEREZ, <em>Chief Justice</em></author>\n    <p id=\"b268-9\">RULING ON DEFENDANT CLAY\u2019S MOTION TO QUASH INDICTMENT</p>\n    <p id=\"b268-10\">Defendant Clay, through counsel, on September 11,1974, filed a motion to quash the indictment. The motion was regularly set for hearing and argued on September 20, 1974, and was then accordingly submitted for ruling.</p>\n    <p id=\"b268-11\">The first ground was based on an allegation that the entire testimony presented to the Grand Jury consisted solely of the admission and confession of co-defendant Reyes. A careful study of the records available to the court indicated that, of the witnesses listed in the indictment, at least one would be able ta testify to facts within his own personal knowledge.</p>\n    <p id=\"b268-12\">On the basis of failure of defendant Clay to show that the indictment was in fact solely based on admission and confession of co-defendant Reyes, it is the opinion of this court that this ground is without merit.</p>\n    <p id=\"b268-13\">The second ground is based on an allegation that defendant Clay was not given any opportunity to testify on his own behalf before the Grand Jury. This court is not aware of any case law, statute or rule requiring that a defendant, without making a request, be given the oppor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>tunity to testify .before the Grand Jury. This ground, therefore, must likewise be denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b269-3\">\u2022 The third ground relied upon was that defendant Clay was not taken before a judge of the Superior Court of Guam immediately after filing of the indictment. The record shows that on August 8, 1974, defendant was brought before the court and properly informed and advised by the court of all of his rights in accordance with law. The third ground, therefore, is denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b269-4\">The fourth ground relied upon alleges \u201cThere is lacking the requisite statutory authority for use of a Grand Jury indictment in the Superior Court of Guam.\u201d Lengthy argument was presented before this court on this particular ground. Counsel contends that since this Grand Jury was impaneled on June 28, 1974, and the impaneling court was the Island Court of Guam, this panel has no standing or authority to sit as a Grand Jury in the Superior Court which came into existence on July 1,1974.</p>\n    <p id=\"b269-5\">For a proper resolution of this ground, it is necessary that we consider the Court Reorganization Act in its entirety rather than to refer to any particular section contained therein.</p>\n    <p id=\"b269-6\">Section 3 of the act enacted Section 65 of the Code of Civil Procedure reading as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b269-7\">Section 65. Pending appeals. All actions and proceedings arising under the laws of Guam pending in the Appellate Division of the District Court of Guam upon the effective date of this Act shall be prosecuted to final determination in that court as though this Act had not been passed. All appeals pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit shall remain in said court and the District Court of Guam shall retain jurisdiction to enter such orders, decrees and judgments and conduct any appropriate proceedings in accordance with the ultimate mandates issued on any such pending appeals.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b269-8\">The Legislature in Section 9 of the act enacted a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Section 89.1 to the Code of Civil Procedure reading as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b270-5\">Section 89.1. Pending cases. All actions and proceedings arising under the laws of Guam pending in the District Court of Guam upon the effective date of this Act, shall be prosecuted to final determination in that Court as though this Act had not been passed.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b270-6\">It is to be noted that nowhere in the act did the Legislature mention what shall be done or what shall happen with pending cases before the Island Court of Guam upon the effective date of the act.</p>\n    <p id=\"b270-7\">The Legislature again in Section 3 of the act enacted Section 66 of the Code of Civil Procedure giving the Judicial Council authority to prescribe rules of procedure. The fourth paragraph of that section reads as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b270-8\">All laws in conflict with such rules shall be of no further force or effect after such rules have taken effect. Any such rules heretofore prescribed by the Judicial Council and reported to the Legislature shall remain in effect until modified or repealed.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b270-9\">The Legislature again in Section 4 of the act enacted Section 81 of the Code of Civil Procedure establishing the composition of the Superior Court and method by which judges of the Superior Court shall be appointed. The second paragraph of this section reads as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b270-10\">In carrying out the provisions of Section 81 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended by the preceding section of this Act, the Chief Judge and judges of the Island Court will then assume the office of Presiding Judge and judges of the Superior Court, respectively, and the Judge of the Police Court will be the Judge of the Superior Court, assigned exclusively to the Traffic Court Division of the Superior Court for terms to expire upon the expiration of their present term of office.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b270-11\">Section 55 of the act reads as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b270-12\">General references. Except where an act of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Congress specifically vests jurisdiction of a cause in the District Court of Guam, every reference in law, rule or regulation to the original jurisdiction of the District Court of Guam, concerning a matter arising under the laws of Guam, shall be read and mean the Superior Court of Guam. Every reference to the Appellate Division of the District Court in law, rule or regulation shall be read and mean the Supreme Court of Guam. Every reference in law, rule or regulation to the Island Court shall be read and mean the Superior Court of Guam.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b271-3\">On reading and interpreting all of these sections together, it seems to this court that had the Legislature intended to abolish the Island Court and create an entirely new court, they would not have overlooked the rather obvious question of what shall happen to the then pending hundreds of cases, important cases, before the Island Court of Guam. Had they so intended, it would have been very simple for the Legislature to follow the provision they set out either in Section 65 of Section 89.1, changed a few wordings and provide that all cases pending in the then Island Court shall be transferred to the Superior Court of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b271-4\">In Section 81, relative to the appointment, tenure and salary of the judges, and referring particularly to the section quoted above, the Legislature simply said \u201cthat the Chief Judge of the Island Court will then assume the Office of Presiding Judge of the Superior Court, that the other judges of the Island Court will then assume the office of judges of the Superior Court\u201d. From this wording of the act, it seems to the court that the formal swear-in-ceremony held on the 1st of July 1974, wherein the judges of the then Island Court were ostensibly sworn in as judges of the Superior Court was nothing but a window dressing for the purpose of giving formal notice to the general public that the Judicial Branch of Guam had finally reached a status of equality with the other two branches of our government.</p>\n    <p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>When the Legislature enacted Section 66 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and referring particularly to the words \u201cany such rules heretofore prescribed by the Judicial Council and reported to the Legislature shall remain in effect until modified or repealed\u201d, this court is of the opinion that the Legislature clearly and unequivocally designated the rules of Criminal Procedure of the Island Court that was prescribed by the Judicial Council, reported to the Legislature and was then in effect on the effective date of the act to remain and be the rules of criminal procedure for the Superior Court of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b272-5\">In addition to all of these, the committee on Judiciary, which studied the bill and held public hearings, on page 2 of its transmittal report to the floor of the Legislature said: \u201cthe bill would in effect establish the Island Court under a different name as the court of original and general jurisdiction in Guam.\u201d</p>\n    <p id=\"b272-6\">In view of all these, the court must conclude that the Superior Court of Guam was in fact a continuation of the Island Court of Guam under a different name with additional jurisdiction. Therefore, since the Island Court of Guam was properly vested with authority to impanel the Grand Jury and did so impanel this Grand Jury and since the Superior Court had not impaneled any Grand Jury, the Grand Jury that returned the indictment in this case was properly constituted, properly impaneled and was with authority and power to return an indictment in this case.</p>\n    <p id=\"b272-7\">Reference was made to the charge to the Grand Jury made by the then assigned criminal judge of the then Island Court of Guam. This court had gone over the complete transcript taken of that charge and found nothing there that was improper. To the contrary, while some courts are not giving charge to the jury, this court is of the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>that in order to have an effective and informed Grand Jury, it is necessary for the judge impaneling the Grand Jury to advise the Grand Jury in general terms of the kind of cases that will come before them, of their responsibility, of their authority and so forth.</p>\n    <p id=\"b273-3\">In 30 American Jurisprudence, 2nd, Page 966, under Section 19, we find: \u201cAlthough in a technical legal sense, the grand jury may be considered charged when it is sworn, it is proper and usual for the court to instruct and advise the grand jurors as to their duties after they are sworn. Some statutes not only require the court to give such a charge, but also to impose on it the duty of including in the charge provisions of the law relating to certain offenses \u2014 \u201d</p>\n    <p id=\"b273-4\">As to alleged rapport between the impaneling judge and the grand jury, in the case of <em>State v. Easter, </em>30 Ohio St. 542, the court held \u201ckinship to the victim of the crime being investigated .does not disqualify a person serving as a Grand Jury\u201d..</p>\n    <p id=\"b273-5\">The grounds raised in numbers 5, 6, and 7, all deal with the sufficiency of the .indictment as , to failure to plead sufficient facts, and that the indictment contains mere conclusions, and that the indictment is vague, indefinite and uncertain. This court is satisfied that the indictment is clear, concise, and sufficient.</p>\n    <p id=\"b273-6\">On ground number 8, it is the hope of this court that counsel did not mean to urge that defendants shall be afforded the privilege of receiving notice of the time and place of the impaneling of a Grand Jury, nor does he intend to infer that each and every defendant shall have the right to attend the selection of the Grand Jury; otherwise, the court will find itself in an untenable position, since to hold to that view would require that the court must go over the entire procedure of selecting a Grand Jury from the very beginning to its completion before each and every person accused of crime can be indicted. Our experience had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>that it would take anywhere from a minimum of 30 days to a maximum of 60 days to impanel a grand jury. Certainly the territory of Guam cannot afford this luxury.</p>\n    <p id=\"b274-5\">This court is satisfied that defendant has the right to object to the array or to the lack of legal qualifications of an individual juror. Such an objection was not raised on ground number eight.</p>\n    <p id=\"b274-6\">It is the feeling of this court that rule 6(b)(1), wherein it says: \u201cchallenges shall be made before the administration of the oath to the jurors and shall be tried by the court\u201d, simply urges or requires that objections to the array of panel be raised at the early stage of the proceeding. <em>Wright v. U.S., </em>165 F.2d 405 (8th Cir. 1948).</p>\n    <p id=\"b274-7\">On ground number 9, with reference to defendant Clay not being afforded the opportunity of insuring the presence of a stenographer to record the proceeding, this court is not aware of any such rights being given a defendant; neither is there any requirement that a stenographer be present to record the proceeding.</p>\n    <p id=\"b274-8\">The motion to quash indictment, is, therefore, denied.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Randall Fennell appeared on behalf of the defendant and the plaintiff was represented by Ronald Geedman.</p>\n    <p id=\"b675-11\">This is a wrongful death action in which the plaintiff seeks damages for pain and suffering, loss to the estate, and punitive damages. The present question is whether the damages prayed for by the plaintiff are properly recoverable in the context of a wrongful death action.</p>\n    <p id=\"b675-12\">Generally, the only type of damages awarded in a wrongful death action are compensation for the pecuniary loss suffered by the plaintiff. <em>Estate of D\u2019India, </em>63 C.A.3d 942; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number><em>Bond v. United Railroad, </em>113 P. 366; <em>Steel v.

Brock, </em>140 C.A. 47. Therefore, we find that damages for loss to the estate are not properly recoverable in this case.</p>\n    <p id=\"b676-6\">It is also clear that punitive damages may not be had in a wrongful death action. <em>Doak v. Superior Court, </em>257 C.A.2d 825; <em>Lange v. Schoettler, </em>47 P. 139.</p>\n    <p id=\"b676-7\">The last type of relief sought concerns the pain and suffering of the decedent. It is established that no recovery, based on the pain and suffering of the decedent, will be awarded in a wrongful death action. <em>Carr v. Pacific Telephone Co., </em>26 C.A.3d 537; <em>Bond v. United Railroad, </em>supra.</p>\n    <p id=\"b676-8\">For the aforementioned reasons, the defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED as to the issue of the damages prayed for in the complaint.</p>\n    <p id=\"b676-9\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

They were originally consolidated for trial in the Island Court. Judgment in both cases was entered against the appellants on March 14, 1960. The appellants appealed from such final judgments, which appeals were dismissed by this Court because of the appellants\u2019 failure to comply with the appellate rules. Mandate was issued under date of January 16, 1961.</p>\n    <p id=\"b88-16\">Under date of February 6,1961, the appellants filed what was designated as \u201cNotice of Intention to Move for New Trial\u201d on the ground of newly discovered evidence, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>under date of February 9, 1961, the appellants filed affidavits in support of such notice. The appellee filed a motion to quash and dismiss the notices of intention, and under date of April 8,1961 the Island Court granted such motion, basing its ruling upon the ground that such procedure is not authorized by Rule 60(b) of the Rules of Procedure of the Island Court of Guam or any other provision of such rules. The Island Court further ordered that execution should issue. The appellants filed notices of appeal under date of April 14, 1961. In this Court the appellee filed motions to dismiss the appeals, which motion was denied under date of June 9, 1961 by the Honorable Thurmond Clarke, Designated Judge.</p>\n    <p id=\"b89-3\">The appellants contend on appeal that under Section 659 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Guam, they had a right to move for a new trial by filing a notice of intention. However, this section, even if applicable, does not help them. Section 659 is part of Article II of the Code of Civil Procedure. Section 657 (c) permits a motion on the ground of newly discovered evidence, but under Section 659, the motion must be made within five (5) days of the entry of judgment. Under Section 659(a), affidavits in support of such notice must be filed within five (5) days thereafter and the responding party has five (5) days in which to file counter affidavits. The Court may extend the time for an additional period not exceeding ten (10) days. Under Section 660 the Court must give precedence to the hearing of such motion and must decide the motion within sixty (60) days; otherwise the motion is considered denied. Under Article II, therefore, the Island Court would have lost jurisdiction to consider a motion for a new trial sixty days after a written notice of the entry of judgment was served, or in May, 1960.</p>\n    <p id=\"b89-4\">The Island Court of Guam is subject to the rule-making authority of the Judicial Council of Guam under Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>123 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In the exercise of this authority the Judicial Council has prescribed procedural rules for the Island Court, which rules parallel those of the Federal Eules of Civil Procedure, including Eule 60, except that the Island Court rule provides for a three-month period after final judgment to move for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence, while the Federal rule provides that a motion for a new trial upon the ground of newly discovered evidence must be filed not more than one (1) year after judgment. No motion was filed within three months.</p>\n    <p id=\"b90-5\">The time for filing such motion begins to run from the entry of final judgment, which judgments were entered in these cases on March 14,1960. This does not mean that the appellants were denied the right to move for a new trial within the three-month period after they had noted an appeal. The case of <em>Smith v. Pollin </em>(C.A. D.C. 1952), 194 F.2d 349, 350, approves the following procedure:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b90-6\">\u201cAppellants\u2019 motion (made to the court of appeals) is for leave to file in the District Court a motion to vacate the judgment of that court .... The text of the motion shows that in substance it is a motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence____</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b90-7\">\u201c. .. In criminal cases ... the procedure is that, when a new trial is sought because of newly discovered evidence in a case pending in the appellate court, a motion for the new trial is made in the District Court, and the District Court may then deny the motion or indicate that it will grant the motion. If that court indicates that it is inclined to grant the motion, a motion for remand is made in the appellate court____</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b90-8\">\u201cThe procedure in civil cases is not so clearly established as it is in criminal cases. The Rules of Civil Procedure make no specific reference to the point .... The Circuit Courts seem to have different views on the subject. See <em>Harper Bros. v. Klaw, </em>2 Cir. 1921, 272 F. 894; <em>Baruch v. Beech Aircraft Corporation, </em>10 Cir. 1949, 172 F.2d 445.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b91-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u201cIt is clear that the District Court could not grant a motion for a new trial in a case which is pending in this court upon appeal. Jurisdiction of the case is in this court while the appeal is pending. So the rule of law applicable to civil cases is exactly the same as the specific statement in Criminal Rule 33. That being so, we think that the procedure already established for criminal cases can be established for civil cases also.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b91-3\">\u201cWe are of opinion, therefore, that, when an appellant in a civil case wishes to make a motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence while his appeal is still pending, the proper procedure is for him to file his motion in the District Court. If that court indicates that it will grant the motion, the appellant should then make a motion in this court for a remand of the case in order that the District Court may grant the motion for new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b91-4\">In <em>Greear v. Greear </em>(1961) 288 F.2d 466, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit followed this procedure and cited with approval <em>Smith v. Pollin, </em>infra.</p>\n    <p id=\"b91-5\">We now consider the question as to whether, after the original appeals were dismissed, the Island Court had jurisdiction to grant a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. We hold that it did not. As pointed out in Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, Vol. 7, P. 338, the trial court may have authority to consider a 60(b) motion after dismissal of appeals without a decision on the issues, but the motion must be timely and must be consistent with the mandate. \u201cThe authorities seem uniform that a mandate from a reviewing court is controlling as to all matters within the compass of such mandate and as to such matters the District Court, after remand, can take no further action.\u201d As any motion must have been made within three months from final judgment, the Island Court was without jurisdiction to consider it under any theory. It will be noted that over two years have expired since the entry of final judgment in the Island Court. The failure to perfect appeals in this Court was not that of the appellee. The following statement is from <em>Perrin v. Aluminum Co. of America </em>(9 Cir. 1952) 197 F.2d 254-255:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b92-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\u201cWe are not prepared to say that the court abused its discretion in any particular. On the contrary we think its discretion was rightly exercised. Rule 60 (b) was not intended to be resorted to as an alternative to review by appeal, nor as a means of enlarging by indirection the time for appeal except in compelling circumstances where justice requires that course. Cf. <em>Hill v. Hawes, </em>320 U.S. 520, 64 S.Ct. 334, 88 L.Ed. 283. Appellants had opportunity to obtain appellate review of the very rulings of which they now complain but failed to take advantage of the opportunity within the time prescribed by Rule 73 (a). Having in consequence of their own lack of diligence been turned away at the front door they now seek entry at the rear. Certainly Rule 60(b) was not designed to afford machinery whereby an aggrieved party may circumvent the policy evidenced by the rule limiting the time for appeal. The case of <em>Commercial Credit Corp. v. United States, </em>8 Cir., 175 F.2d 905, cited by counsel on oral argument, is clearly not in point.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b92-3\">\u201cAffirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b92-4\">We are of the view that the back door in these cases should now be closed. Accordingly, we affirm the orders of dismissal in the Island Court.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Of the various parcels of land, of which titles were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>sought to be registered by the appellees, appellants objected only to that small parcel designated as Lot No. 2061, also known as a portion of the Old Agana River.</p>\n    <p id=\"b136-5\">Appellants in their counter-claim against plaintiffs (appellees), and in their cross-claim against the Government of Guam did not seek to have title to the land in question registered in their names, nor do they claim to be owners of said land. What appellants did seek was a dismissal of appellees\u2019 petition and a cancellation of a quitclaim deed issued by the Government of Guam to the Appellees covering the disputed lot.</p>\n    <p id=\"b136-6\">Aside from the other contentions of appellants such as the alleged erroneous dismissal of the cross-claim against the Government and the alleged error on the part of the trial court in its failure to direct the entry of a final judgment upon appellants\u2019 cross-claim and the entry of a final judgment in favor of appellees upon their claim without making an express determination that there was no just reason for delay; appellants relied primarily upon the alleged error in the finding of the trial court that one of the appellants learned of the public hearing held by the Land Transfer Board at which hearing the application of the appellees for the acquisition of the disputed lot was then being considered.</p>\n    <p id=\"b136-7\">Appellants contended that the failure of the Land Transfer Board to give notice to the appellants concerning the Board\u2019s meeting of April 16, 1959 wherein appellees\u2019 application for the purchase of the land in dispute was considered, was such as to make the ultimate conveyance of such disputed land to appellees void.</p>\n    <p id=\"b136-8\">While the evidence as shown by the record might have been nebulous as to the actual delivery to appellant, Oliva T. Cruz, of the notice of hearing of the Land Transfer Board held on April 16, 1959, there is evidence to show that notice of the hearing was posted in at least two or three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>different places in Agana and all the other municipalities in Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b137-3\">Great weight was placed by the appellants upon the Land Transfer Board\u2019s non-compliance of the provisions of Paragraph 16, Rules and Regulations of the Land Transfer Board, approved by the Governor of Guam on December 29, 1951, which requires that a public notice of the Board\u2019s regular meeting be published in a newspaper of general circulation at least three (3) days prior to such regular meeting.</p>\n    <p id=\"b137-4\">While it is borne by the evidence that the Land Transfer Board did not publish any notice of its April 16, 1959 meeting in a newspaper of general circulation, we are of the opinion that the Land Transfer Board was not derelict in its duty as such publication of notice of regular meeting in a newspaper of general circulation was no longer a requirement in 1959.</p>\n    <p id=\"b137-5\">On August 9, 1956 by virtue of the enactment of Public Law 105, Third Guam Legislature, Section 13507, Title XIV, Government Code of Guam as enacted provides:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b137-6\">\u201cSection 13507. Same: Same: Notice and Hearing Required: Consideration by the Board.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b137-7\">(a) ...</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b137-8\">(b) ...</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b137-9\">(c) ... Notice to the public may be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in Guam or by posting in at least two public places in each village in Guam ....\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b137-10\">Appellants contended that Section 13507 did not supersede or repeal Paragraph 16 of the Rules and Regulations of the Land Transfer Board as approved in December 1951. It is appellants\u2019 contention that this section of the Government Code provides the Board with the authority to make notice to the public sufficient by merely posting a notice of meeting in two public places in each village in Guam if the Board should so provide. We do not adhere to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>such contention, as in our opinion Section 13507, Title XIV, Government Code of Guam supersedes Paragraph 16 of the Land Transfer Board\u2019s Rules and Regulations of 1951.</p>\n    <p id=\"b138-5\">We construe Section 13507 (c) of the Government Code of Guam as it relates to giving of notice of the Board\u2019s regular meeting to the general public, to mean that the Land Transfer Board could give notice of its regular meeting to the general public in two different ways: The Board could have such notice of meeting published in a newspaper of general circulation. This publication would therefore preclude the necessity of posting the notice in at least two different places in each village in Guam. If the Board should decide that notice of meeting should be given to the general public by the posting of such notice in at least two different places in each village, then such would suffice and the publication in a newspaper of general circulation would not be necessary.</p>\n    <p id=\"b138-6\">The posting of the notice of the Land Transfer Board\u2019s regular meeting of April 16, 1959, in two different places in each village in Guam properly satisfied the requirements of Section 13507 of the Government Code of Guam; hence the general public including the appellants herein were duly notified of the Board\u2019s regular meeting of April 16, 1959. We therefore hold that the appellants\u2019 contention that they did not have notice of the public hearing is untenable and should be disregarded. We further hold that the appellants\u2019 contention that the conveyance by the government to the appellees of the disputed lot is void, has no basis whatever and should be ignored.</p>\n    <p id=\"b138-7\">We have also examined the record especially as it relates to appellants\u2019 other contentions on appeal and we find no merits on such contentions.</p>\n    <p id=\"b138-8\">Since the evidence did show that the decree of registration was proper, we, therefore, affirm.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

In this interim decision, the Court declared valid and in effect the three year agreement between the Territorial Board of Education and the Guam Federation of Teachers. It further determined that the acts of the defendants did not fall within the purview of Section 4376 defining strikes. It declared void Section 39 of Public Law 13-37 as violating Section 29(b) and Section 5(j) of the Organic Act of Guam. This Court further held that Executive Order No. 75-38 did not abrogate the terms of the three year agreement. A period of forty-five (45) days was provided to allow for a smooth transition in order that Department of Education may comply with the terms of the agreement.</p>\n    <p id=\"AZU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>FACTS</p>\n    <p id=\"b310-3\">The plaintiff, the People of the Territory of Guam hereinafter referred to as the Government, commenced a civil action arising under Section 4378 of Chapter VI, Title V of the Government of Guam against the Guam Federation of Teachers alleging, among other things, that defendant\u2019s Union members acted in concert announcing and stating their refusal to accept children in excess of the ratio as set forth in the agreement. (See Paragraph 8 of the complaint.) The complaint further alleges a refusal to instruct 300 minutes (see Paragraph 9 of the complaint), and the defendants inspired and incited others to assist in the conduct as set forth in Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the complaint (Paragraph 10).</p>\n    <p id=\"b310-4\">The relief sought here by the Government is that they be granted a permanent restraining order from continuing the acts as set forth in the complaint.</p>\n    <p id=\"b310-5\">The defendant Union thereafter on August 28, 1975, filed an answer to the complaint filed denying in substance the allegation of the complaint, and filed on August 29, 1975, a counterclaim. In the said counterclaim, the defendants seek specific, performance and observance of all the terms of the three year agreement. They also seek to enjoin the Government, its Board of Education, its Director of Education, agents, and servants from giving any directives, orders, or instructions which would be contra to the above aforementioned agreement.</p>\n    <p id=\"b310-6\">This dispute arose as a result of the existence of an agreement called \u201cThree Year Agreement.\u201d The parties to the agreement are the Territorial Board of Education and the Guam Federation of Teachers. The agreement was ratified by the duly appointed representatives of the respective parties on October 1, 1972, and approved pursuant to law by Carlos G. Camacho, the then duly elected Governor of Guam on October 3, 1972. In the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>agreement under Article XIII, it provides for <em>the </em>duration of the contract. In the article, it provides that it shall remain in effect until June 13, 1975, and renewable from year to year unless certain conditions are met. The most important sentence is the fact that the contract shall remain in effect until a new contract is ratified.</p>\n    <p id=\"b311-3\">The 13th Guam Legislature passed Public Law 13-37, and it became law on June 27, 1975. In this public law, we find Section 39 (subsections A thru S), which dictates to the Department of Education certain directives regarding substitute teachers, librarians, counselors, assistant principals, and the entire spectrum of personnel administration. It further speaks of and establishes a teacher ratio, which is diametrically opposite to that provided in Chapter V of the Third Party Agreement. It also includes the transfer of Driver Education Program, travel, and various other and sundry matters concerning the administration of our public school system.</p>\n    <p id=\"b311-4\">Our public schools opened their doors to commence another year and as school bells rang, registration of the pupils began. The defendant Union, armed with the contract, refused to accept any students beyond the ratio as set forth in the contract. On August 21, 1975, the Governor, under powers delegated to him (Section 29(b) Organic Act), issued Executive Order No. 75-38, wherein he cites that portion of the Organic Act giving him the power to establish, maintain, and operate public schools in the Territory of Guam. In this executive order, he re-affirms the authority of the Board of Education as a policy making body, which governs primary and secondary schools, and further re-affirms the principle of Collective Bargaining. There is a directive in the executive order to the Board of Education to use its best judgment in matters of class sizes, instructional time, administrative and personnel leave, determining curriculum. In this in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>strument, the Governor makes mention of the existing contract, budget limitations, and appropriations.</p>\n    <p id=\"b312-3\">The defendants positioned themselves in the legal arena armed with a contract and seek enforcement of the provisions of this Three Year Agreement. The Government, on the other hand, seeks injunctive relief restraining activities of union members.</p>\n    <p id=\"b312-4\">\n      <em>The Three Year Agreement between the Territorial Board of Education and the Guam Federation of Teachers Local is valid and subsisting.</em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"b312-5\">A close examination of Article XIII entitled Duration as set forth in the Three Year Agreement, gives this Court no problem in reaching a conclusion that it is a valid and subsisting contract in full force and effect. The language is clear in the wording \u201cnotwithstanding the first sentence of this Article, the provisions of this contract will remain in effect until a <em>new contract is ratified and put in </em>effect.\u201d The first sentence recites a termination date. What other interpretation could be given than that reached by the Court. To rule otherwise would do violence to reason.</p>\n    <p id=\"b312-6\">\n      <em>That the activities of the defendants did not constitute a strike within the meaning of Section JpS76 of the Government Code of Guam.</em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"b312-7\">On the opening of school day, students of our public schools entering in the halls of learning, were advised that the union member teachers would not register students in excess of that provided for under the terms of the contract (see Article V). The Government contends that these activities as set forth in their .complaint, Paragraphs 8, 9, and 10, constituted a strike. Section 4876 of the Government Code states that:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b312-8\">It shall be unlawful:</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b312-9\">(a) For any government employee to participate in any strike against the government.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b313-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>(b) For any person, by picketing or otherwise to instigate, induce, procure, order, direct, coerce, or incite any violation of this Chapter, or to undertake to concert with another to violate this Chapter.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b313-3\">In Section 4375 of the Government Code of Guam, the word strike is defined as temporary stoppage, slowdown or the retardation of work or services by concerted action of employees. How could it be said that the activities of the defendant members constituted a strike? In a careful examination of their activities, they embarked upon school registration insulated with the collective bargaining agreement, which was valid and in effect at the time of registration. Was there really a retardation of work or services by concerted action to fall within the strike definition? This Court thinks not. The chaotic condition, if one existed, was generated by the administrative guidelines and legislative intervention (Public Law 13-37, Section 39). To grant injunctive relief sought herein would cause a malignant growth to justice.</p>\n    <p id=\"b313-4\">\n      <em>That a period of forty-five (l\u00a1-5) days be allowed Government to comply with the Three Year Agreement.</em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"b313-5\">This Court has set a period of time namely forty-five (45) days to allow the Government, the Director of Education, its agents and servants to re-arrange, alter, or modify classroom schedules and other instructional teaching consistent with the terms of the contract. This period of time, it is felt, is a reasonable period for compliance.</p>\n    <p id=\"b313-6\">\n      <em>That Public Law 13-37, Section 39 is void as it violates Section 29(b) and Section 5(f) of the Organic Act of Guam.</em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"b313-7\">The legislature of Guam saw fit to create legislation that invaded the power of those delegated to the Executive Branch of the territory. The Organic Act of Guam, Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>11 grants powers to the legislature to all subjects of legislation of local application not inconsistent with the provisions of the Organic Act On reading Section 29 (b) of the Organic Act, this Court has little difficulty in reaching the conclusion that such legislative intervention invaded powers specifically delegated. Section 29(b) states:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b314-5\">(b) The Governor shall provide an adequate public educational system of Guam, and to that end shall establish, maintain, and operate public schools at such places in Guam as may be necessary.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b314-6\">The Government contends that a fiscal emergency existed and that there was an exercise of police powers in the passage of Section 39 of Public Law 13-37. This position is untenable. It is quite clear that exclusive power to maintain and operate the school system was delegated to the Governor and not in the halls of the legislature. It is therefore quite clear that the legislature is without any authority to involve itself in the internal affairs of the educational system.</p>\n    <p id=\"b314-7\">\n      <em>That the Executive Order No. 75-88 did not abrogate any of the terms of the existing Three Year Agreement.</em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"b314-8\">In the Governor\u2019s Executive Order No. 75-38, it cites authority to maintain and establish the school systems. (See \u00a7 29 Organic Act supra.) The executive order is simply a display that all matters set forth in Section 39 of Public Law 13-37 is not within the power of the legislature. It further speaks of the existing contract and asks the Board to guide the Department in its operation and personnel matters, including actual class size and instructional time. The Attorney General, who appeared in this action, urged the Court that the Governor exercised his police powers in the issuance of this executive order. Once it is determined that the Executive Branch is the appropriate agency to exercise this residual power, the next matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>to determine is whether or not this power was exercised. This Court is of the opinion that Executive Order No, 75-38 does not constitute such exercise. Rather, this order merely may be characterized as a general statement by the Governor of the relative relationship of the Executive and Legislative Branches, with respect to the educational system on Guam. It further demonstrates an equally general statement of the executive\u2019s position with respect to the potential conflict between the existing agreement and budget limitations. Nowhere has this executive order displayed mention of emergency conditions, which requires him to nullify contract provisions, or that in fact any of the provisions were thereby invalidated. Therefore, it can be concluded that this order is equally found wanting as an exercise by a government entity to nullify certain contract provisions to preserve the common good. Because use of police powers can affect fundamental constitutionally, as well as organically, protected rights, it must be used with utmost caution and only upon showing a real genuine cause. (See <em>Home Building and Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, </em>290 U.S. 395.)</p>\n    <p id=\"b315-3\">The Government further contends that the contract provisions is a nullity by operation of \u00a7 4411 of the Government Code of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b315-4\">Section 4411 states:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b315-5\">Government management officials shall retain the right and responsibility, in accordance with applicable law and. regulations to (a) maintain efficient government operations and direct public employees, (b) hire, promote, transfer and assign employees to government positions, (c) suspend, demote, discharge, or take other disciplinary action against employees for just cause, (d) to determine the methods, organization, and assignment of personnel for the conduct of operations, including necessary actions in emergency situations.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b315-6\">This section makes it unlawful for certain management responsibilities to be relinquished by those duly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>entrusted with them. The Government argues that the provisions set forth in Article V of the Three Year Agreement are contra to \u00a7 4411 of the Government Code of Guam. In support of this contention, the Government cites <em>Jefferson Elementary School District v. Bert, </em>116 California Reporter 554 (1974). The Jefferson case has no value to support the position of the Government simply because the education structure of Guam and California are different. The educational system in California is unique. This Court can hold no other opinion than that the specific provisions, which are alleged to constitute \u201cUltra Vires\u201d acts in conjunction with section 4411 of the Government Code of Guam, cannot be characterized as such. The only possible language in \u00a7 4411 subsection (d) \u201cto determine the methods, organization, and assignment of personnel for the conduct of operations, including necessary actions in emergency situations.\u201d This portion of the section, read in its broadest fashion, does not appear to this Court to preclude the bargaining away of authority over class sizes or number of hours taught.</p>\n    <p id=\"b316-3\">Therefore in view of the foregoing, the motion to dismiss the complaint of the Government is hereby granted, to the extent that the temporary injunction will continue for a period of forty-five (45) days to allow the Government time to re-assess the personnel to comply with the contract. The interim decision made by this Court on September 5, 1975, is hereby incorporated in this decision by reference.</p>\n    <p id=\"b316-4\">Submit findings of fact and conclusions of law, giving the Government ten (10) days notice of presentment.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The Court does not find that the fact that the Government was included in the notice and motion for jury trial as party defendants sufficient cause to dismiss this action. Rather the Court construes the motion for jury trial as only applying to those party defendants, other than the Government, who are entitled to have their factual issues resolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>by jury deliberation. Further, the Court believes that for purpose of more efficient judicial administration that this action with respect to all the parties including the Government proceed with a jury impanelled, however, leaving the issues in controversy relative to the Government to remain within the province of the judge presiding over the trial for determination. The Court finds support for this procedural posturing of this action in the cases of: <em>United States v. Yellow Cab. Co., </em>304 U.S. 543, 555-556 (1951); <em>Simon v. Lougreen, </em>368 F.Supp. 265, 270 (D.C.V.I. 1973); <em>Englehardt v. United States, </em>69 F.Supp. 451, 455 (D.C. Md. 1947). However the Court notes in passing that if this posturing creates any undue hardship for the Government, they can always seek procedural relief by seeking to avail themselves of <em>Rule J/\u00a3(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure for the Superior Court of Guam.</em></p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

After oral argument was heard, Judge Gilmartin died. The remaining judges still constitute a quorum.</p>\n    <p id=\"b166-15\">Defendant-appellant\u2019s first ground for a reversal of the order was predicated on his contention that the lower court abused its discretion in denying the motion to vacate the judgment entered after the hearing on June 15, 1959.</p>\n    <p id=\"b167-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>The cause based on a complaint for damages was filed in the Island Court on October 22, 1958. The issues having been joined by an answer filed by the defendant in propria persona on November 14, 1958, the plaintiff-appellee filed on November 18, 1958 a motion to have the cause set for trial. In the meantime the defendant-appellant had retained the legal services of his present counsel. This first motion of plaintiff-appellee to set the cause for trial was followed by a series of similar motions the last one of which was filed on May 5, 1959. In the interval there were two separate notices of trials filed and served on the defendant-appellant and his counsel setting the cause for trial first on March 10, 1959 and then on March 30, 1959. The third and final notice of trial scheduled the hearing of the cause for June 15, 1959. This final notice was filed on June 11, and served on the defendant-appellant on the same date. As contended by defendant-appellant, his counsel departed from Guam on June 1, 1959, but subsequent to his departure, and preceding the date of trial, an employee of defendant-appellant\u2019s counsel informed the \u201coffice of the court\u201d that appellant\u2019s counsel was off the island and that the cause then scheduled to be heard on June 15, 1959 should be continued until the return of counsel to the island.</p>\n    <p id=\"b167-3\">On June 15, 1959 plaintiff-appellee and his counsel appeared in court. As ascertained from the record the defendant-appellant failed to appear. The court then proceeded to hear the cause and at the conclusion of plaintiff-appellee\u2019s cause the court found for said plaintiff-appellee.</p>\n    <p id=\"b167-4\">On July 28, 1959 defendant-appellant filed his motion to have the judgment vacated and set aside on the ground that on the scheduled date of trial appellant\u2019s counsel was away from the island. It was this order of the court denying the motion to vacate and set aside the judgment that is now being considered under this appeal.</p>\n    <p id=\"b168-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>From the foregoing it is patently obvious that plaintiffappellee undertook a diligent pursuit to have the cause heard on an early date, by his consistent filing of motions to have the cause set for trial. While the record is not clear as to why the cause was not heard on March 10, 1959 its first scheduled hearing date, and again on March 30, 1959 when it was scheduled for trial the second time, the consistent effort of the plaintiff to have the cause heard would lead one to safely assume that any postponement of the trial could not be properly attributed to the plaintiff. Assuming that the request made by the defendant to have ,the case continued because of his counsel\u2019s absence from the island could be construed as a motion for continuance, still the defendant could not properly presume that such motion for continuance is granted by the court in the absence of any express order by the court to such effect. In our opinion if there is any abuse, such abuse would properly rest on defendant by his taking undue advantage of the plaintiff\u2019s tolerance and the patience of the court. The defendant has utterly failed to show how the court has abused its discretion. Despite the absence of defendant\u2019s counsel from the island, the defendant could still have appeared in court on the date of trial as he was fully aware that such trial of the cause was scheduled for that date. He should have known ahead of time that his counsel would not be available to represent him so as to get another counsel .to act on his behalf. This the defendant has failed to do.</p>\n    <p id=\"b168-3\">The other points raised by the defendant as ground for reversal of the order are utterly devoid of any merit and should be disregarded.</p>\n    <p id=\"b168-4\">On the basis of the foregoing the order of the lower court denying appellant\u2019s motion to have the judgment vacated and set aside, is hereby affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The case was tried to a jury which returned its verdict in the following form:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b229-11\">\u201cWe, the Jury, find the defendant Guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b229-12\">In considering the form of the verdict returned by the jury, we find that it was fatally defective. It must be remembered that each count of an Information constitutes a separate accusation, and the defendant is entitled ,to the jury\u2019s careful consideration of each offense charged. In the case before us, each count alleged a late payment of wages to each of twelve separate employees. From this fact alone, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>it might appear at first glance that the verdict was a proper one. However, the record reveals that different situations obtained as to the various employees and it is entirely conceivable that, had the jury considered each of the charged offenses separately, it could have found defendant not guilty as to one or more of those counts; and perhaps it meant to do so. If reasonable minds would not question the meaning of a verdict as returned, then its form will not affect .the result of a case. Such is not the case here, however, for reasonable minds could well differ as to precisely what was meant by the trial jury in its verdict. Did it mean that the defendant was guilty of each and every count? Did it mean that .the defendant was guilty of some, but no.t all, of the counts? Did it mean that the jury had found defendant guilty as to one or more of the counts and had made no determination as to the remainder? If the information contains more than one Count, the verdict must clearly indicate to which count it refers. <em>People v. Powers, </em>272 Mich. 303, 261 N.W. 543 (1935); <em>State v. Highley, </em>102 S.W.2d 563 (Mo. 1937). Accordingly, we find that the form of the verdict was fatally defective so as to require us to reverse the judgment entered upon it. For guidance, we believe that in cases that may arise in the future and which contain multiple counts, it would be well to follow the suggestion set forth in <em>People v. Cassella, </em>58 Cal.App. 547, 209 P. 40 (1922), that the jury be furnished with a form of verdict substantially as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b230-5\"><em>\u201cWe, </em>the Jury, find the defendant.................................as charged in the first Count of the Information; we find him............................ as charged in the second Count...................................................., etc.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b230-8\">The utilization of such a form of verdict should go far to eliminate the type of confusion with which the trial court was faced in this case.</p>\n    <p id=\"b230-9\">We have considered the other purported grounds for appeal, and we find the same to be without merit.</p>\n    <p id=\"b231-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>For the reasons set forth herein, the judgment of the trial court in this case is reversed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

We reject the Prosecutor\u2019s argument based upon Within, California Criminal Procedure, pg. 190, because the converse of that rule, pg. 191, is more applicable here. \u201c. . . where the exception is a part of the statutory definition or description of the crime, one of the elements to be pleaded is the nonexistence of the facts giving rise to the exception.\u201d A logical analysis of traditional Chamorro culture in this Territory makes it clear that Section 12315 of the Government Code, of itself, cannot possibly define an offense in unconditional terms. Therefore, exceptions to Section 12315, whether couched in negative or positive language, must exist. Without implementing regulations promulgated, under Section 12321 in accordance with procedure set forth in Section 12007, to give active meaning to said Section 12315, Defendant\u2019s 6th Amendment right is violated by being charged thereunder.</p>\n    <p id=\"b381-3\">Had regulations been promulgated the Prosecution would be under an obligation to: (1) give the official citation of the rule which Defendant allegedly violated; (2) state the specific nature of the alleged crime; (3) plead to nonexistence of facts giving rise to any exception which nullify the illegality of Defendant\u2019s acts. But where no regulations have been promulgated, Section 12315 alone cannot be used to criminally accuse Defendant because Defendant does not know with clarity what wrongful act he is accused of doing.</p>\n    <p id=\"b381-4\">It is not Defendant\u2019s obligation to research the existence or nonexistence of a regulation which might apply. Yet an information lacking specificity negates the Defendant\u2019s ability to prepare a defense. The government is obligated to provide an accused with a \u201c. . . plain, concise and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged\u201d. (Rule 7(c)).

The plaintiffs\u2019 motions for judgments on the pleading, or in the alternative for summary judgments, were heard and submitted for decision on April 24, 1979. The defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment was heard and submitted for decision on May 9,1979.</p>\n    <p id=\"b653-16\">Plaintiff David Shimizu entered into a contract with the government of Guam on December 7,1978, to serve as Men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>tal Health Coordinator for a period of twelve (12) months. He commenced his employment on December 18, 1978. On or about January 3, 1979, the Acting Administrator of the Mental Health and Substance Abuse Agency directed the plaintiff to vacate his office. By letter of January 8, 1979, the Acting Administrator terminated his contract.</p>\n    <p id=\"b654-5\">Plaintiff Joseph Cruz entered into a contract with the government of Guam on December 20, 1978, and commenced his employment as Personnel Manager for the Public Utilities Agency of Guam on December 28, 1978. The contract is for a period of two (2) years. On January 2, 1979, the plaintiff was directed to leave his work by the Acting Chief Officer of the Public Utilities Agency of Guam, and on January 10,1979, the same person, by letter, notified the plaintiff that the contract was terminated.</p>\n    <p id=\"b654-6\">Matters outside of the pleadings have been considered and the plaintiffs\u2019 motions are treated as motions for summary judgment. Kule 12 (c).</p>\n    <p id=\"b654-7\">Neither position as Personnel Manager nor as Mental Health Coordinator exists within the Merit System of the government of Guam and no application to create such new positions has been made by the Governor.</p>\n    <p id=\"b654-8\">In each of these cases, all the allegations of the complaints have been admitted by the defendant, except the allegation that declaratory relief is appropriate. The defendant asserts as an affirmative defense that the contracts are void. The contracts appear fair and regular. The burden of proof, therefore, is on the defendant to assert illegality of the contracts. The court believes the defendant has properly done this by raising it in his affirmative defense.</p>\n    <p id=\"b654-9\">In oral argument, the defendant said that there may be an issue of fact as to whether or not the contracts are for \u201cprofessional or technical services\u201d for \u201ctemporary\u201d period. Section 4002(a) (5) of the Government Code of Guam. The plaintiffs in oral argument on April 24, 1979, made it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>clear that it is their position that the contracts fall within this Section. Nevertheless, the defendant submitted no factual matter to the contrary by the time his motion was argued on May 9,1979.</p>\n    <p id=\"b655-3\">It is the defendant\u2019s position that the contracts are illegal since they are attempts to evade the Merit System required by the laws of Guam. The court, however, cannot permit the defendant to merely rest on his affirmative defense alleged in his answer <em>(Higgins v. Baker, </em>309 F.Supp., at 639) since there is clear authority in the law for hiring outside the Merit System. Section 1422 of the Organic Act of Guam; \u00a7 4107 of the Government Code of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b655-4\">In support of his position that the contracts are void, the defendant, other than' the answer, made no showing that the appointments were not based on \u201cmerit\u201d, or that the manner of selection was not \u201cfree of political consideration\u201d, or that it was \u201cpracticable\u201d to have based the contracts on competitive practical tests and evaluations. Section 4001 of the Government Code of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b655-5\">The defendant\u2019s position has been that the plaintiffs must make an affirmative factual showing that it was impractical to make the appointments within the Merit System and that they are both contracts to render temporary professional or technical services. On the contrary, the defendant must by an affirmative factual showing demonstrate that the contract is illegal. He is not entitled to rely merely on the allegation of an affirmative defense.</p>\n    <p id=\"b655-6\">The defendant also alleges that the termination of the contracts was justified under \u00a7 4107 of the Government Code of Guam, since the Governor has not submitted the positions to the Civil Service Commission. This Section does not furnish any support for the affirmative defense that the contracts were void. On the date of the termination of the Cruz contract, thirty (30) days had not elapsed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>since the creation of the position, and as to neither had sixty (60) days elapsed during which the Commission could act. The failure of the Governor to submit the positions cannot make the contracts void. These cases do not raise \u00a7 4107 problems.</p>\n    <p id=\"b656-5\">For the reasons stated, it is ordered that the plaintiffs\u2019 motions be, and they hereby are, granted.</p>\n    <p id=\"b656-6\">It is further ordered that the defendant\u2019s motions be, and they hereby are, denied.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The hair found at the scene was compared by the People\u2019s chemist with one taken from the defendant pursuant to a warrant and were reported as similar. The hair found at the scene was subject to several tests and in a normal course of performance of the last test it was crushed and exposed to certain substances. The remnants were discarded. The defendant is obviously unable now to make independent tests (which were authorized by the court and were not objected to by the People) to either corroborate or impeach the findings of the People\u2019s chemist. No bad faith on the part of the People or its agents exists.</p>\n    <p id=\"b284-9\">The factual issue is whether or not it was proper procedure and warranted to have used the entire hair in the final test and then discarded the remnants.</p>\n    <p id=\"b284-10\">At the hearing of this motion, the chemist for the People and the chemist for the defendant testified extensively.</p>\n    <p id=\"b284-11\">The final test conducted by the People\u2019s chemist was to determine the blood grouping of the hair. The hair was one to one and one-half inches long (2.54 to 3.81 centimeters). In conducting the final test the chemist divided the hair into three sections for the testing to determine A, B or 0 blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>grouping. He testified that sections of one-half to three-quarters. of an inch were the shortest .sections that he had used in any blood grouping tests.</p>\n    <p id=\"b285-3\">The People\u2019s chemist\u2019s tests were to compare 4 pubic hairs and one head hair found at the scene with hairs of the 3 victims and the 2 defendants. The only similarity found by him were the pubic hair in question and the defendant\u2019s pubic hair.</p>\n    <p id=\"b285-4\">The defendant\u2019s chemist testified that the shortest section he had tested was about b centimeter and he usually tested sections of to 1 centimeter. Thus the defendant\u2019s chemist would require a hair of <em>Vh </em>to 3 centimeters in length.</p>\n    <p id=\"b285-5\">The defendant\u2019s chemist also stated that the circumstances of this case indicated that the best procedure required the retaining of a portion of the hair unaltered so that later tests by others could be made; that it wouldn\u2019t be \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d to have used the entire hair; that rather than a comparison test as was done with a \u201cknown hair\u201d, better results are achieved by \u201cblind\u201d testing where the source of all hairs is unknown; that even the remnants of the hair following the blood grouping tests might have some value for later testing.</p>\n    <p id=\"b285-6\">The People\u2019s chemist testified on this last point that he would not rely on the results of subsequent testing of the hair remnants after the blood grouping test.</p>\n    <p id=\"b285-7\">Both experts testified as to a general policy of the importance of evidence preservation that is a part of their field, but did not cite specific procedures covering a case such as this.</p>\n    <p id=\"b285-8\">The court finds that the destruction of the hair occurred during an investigatory test conducted by a qualified chemist using reasonable means.</p>\n    <p id=\"b285-9\">I conclude that the People have met their burden of explaining the non-production of the hair which was their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>duty to preserve once it was taken as evidence. <em>U.S. v.

In paragraph II of their complaint they alleged that they are husband and wife and had been in continuous, actual, notorious and open possession of certain land in Guam. In paragraph III they alleged that they were the owners of such land since 1946 and had constructed a house thereon. The complaint then alleges that a land registration action was filed in the Island Court in 1957 and that an abstract filed in connection therewith showed interests on the part of plaintiffs. The remainder of the complaint then alleges judicial proceedings in the Island Court of Guam, and in the prayer the plaintiffs ask that certain adverse judgments be set aside. We are not concerned with the merits of these various contentions. It appears that the appellants had been ordered to vacate the premises, which order was stayed by the Island Court, and the appellee here, under date of February 2, 1961, filed a motion to quash the order staying the ejectment proceedings, to dismiss the complaint filed herein, and for an order to enforce the ejectment. In the motion it was alleged that under the principle of \u201cres judicata\u201d the issues presented by the complaint had all been decided in the various court actions below. Under date of February 7, 1961, the Island Court \u00e9ntered its order in which it made specific findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>adverse to the appellants and held that the issues presented by the complaint had been decided in the various court proceedings and that the matters raised in the complaint were \u201cres judicata.\u201d The appeal followed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b100-5\">We are of the opinion that we must reverse under the authority of <em>Guam Investment Company, Inc. v. Central Building, Inc. </em>(1961), 288 F.2d 19. In this case, as in the instant case, the District Court of Guam had dismissed a subsequently-filed complaint on the ground of \u201cres judicata.\u201d The District Court held that previous litigation had disposed of the issues raised in the complaint. In reversing the District Court, the Court of Appeals stated;</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b100-6\">\u201cIn the order of dismissal of the complaint the district court stated that it took judicial notice of record in Civil No. 49-55, and that all issues raised in the present case were finally settled and adjudicated in said case and that plaintiffs [appellants] are therefore forever barred and precluded from raising said issues in the present or in any further action. The above mentioned order of dismissal was entered notwithstanding the fact that the appellees filed no responsive pleading to the complaint of appellants, nor was the record in the prior case, Civil No. 49-55, offered or received in evidence.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b100-7\">\u201cRule 8, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which is entitled \u2018General Rules of Pleading\u2019, provides in (c) thereof in material parts as follows: \u2018(c) Affirmative Defenses. In pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively . . . , res judicata, . . . .\u2019 The general rule applicable to this situation is well stated in <em>Lowe, etc., et al. v. McDonald, et al. </em>(9th Cir. 1955), 221 F.2d 228, as follows:</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b100-8\">\u2018As a general rule, a court in one case will not take judicial notice of its own records in another and distinct case even between the same parties, unless the prior proceedings are introduced into evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b101-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>\u201cAs stated in <em>Paridy v. Caterpillar Tractor Co. </em>(7th Cir., 1931), 48 F.2d 166, at page 169:</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b101-3\">\u201cThe reason for the rule above referred to is that the decision of a cause must depend upon the evidence introduced. If the courts should recognize judicially facts adjudicated in another case, it makes those facts, though unsupported by evidence in the case in hand, conclusive against the opposing party; while if they had been properly introduced they might have been met and overcome by him. So, on a plea of res adjudicaba, a court cannot judicially notice that the matters in issue are the same as those in a former suit. Such matters must be pleaded and proved. 15 R.G.L. p. 1111, \u00a7 42.\u2019 \u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b101-4\">Rule 8(c) of the Island Court Rules is the same as Rule 8 (c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the <em>Guam Investment Company case, </em>supra, is therefore controlling. We note that during the course of oral argument the appellants contended that their action is primarily one to quiet title and not one for declaratory judgment. We do not determine the question as to whether the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to justify relief, as the Island Court based its conclusion on res judicata. We simply hold that the defense of res judicata must be raised as an affirmative defense and supported. Reversed for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n    <footnote label=\"3\">\n      <p id=\"b100-9\"><em>\u20183 National Surety Co. v.

The appellants assert the Court was without authority to dismiss in any event without determining the issue involved and, secondly, that the dismissal was not in accordance with the Rules of the Island Court. We affirm the Island Court on both issues.</p>\n    <p id=\"b427-4\">This action was originally filed in the District Court of Guam in a complaint filed November 4,1964. The complaint alleged that the land in question had been registered under the Land Title Registration Act of Guam and that there was a dispute between the parties as to the location of the dividing line. The District Court conducted proceedings, including a pretrial conference. It then concluded that any dispute involving land so registered was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Island Court. The case was transferred to that Court, which heard evidence. The appellants were unable to obtain the type of survey which they insist is essential for a determination of the issue. The appellees moved to have the case dismissed, which motion was granted at proceedings dated May 6, 1966, at which time counsel for the appellants stated that the true survey line had not been established and until the true line was located there is nothing anybody can do. The appellants were on notice that the motion to dismiss for lack of prosecution was to be argued and were present. Counsel for the appellants stated to the Court that the appellants could not go forward with their proof. In <em>Montgomery v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>367 F.2d 917 (9th Cir., 1966), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated the rule as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b427-5\">The grounds which were set forth in support of the motion to vacate the order of dismissal were essentially the same as those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>which are claimed to have required that the Tax Court grant taxpayer\u2019s motions for continuance. If the denials of a continuance were justified, then there is no sound basis for the attack upon the order of dismissal. There is inherent power in a court, acting within the \u201cpermissible range\u201d of its discretion, to dismiss a civil action for lack of prosecution. <em>Link v. Wabash Railroad Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 633, 8 L.Ed.2d 734, 82 S.Ct. 1386 (1962).</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b428-5\">The basic problem presented here is that there is no dispute between the parties as to the description of their respective lands and the fact that such lands have a common boundary. The dispute stems from the fact that the appellants are unable to furnish a survey which starts at Monument No. 1 in Agana. Such evidence as was presented involves surveys which were based upon other monuments. As stated in 12 Am. Jur.2d 633:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b428-6\">The burden of proof upon an issue as to the boundary is upon the party having the affirmative of that issue. This burden must generally be established by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b428-7\">The appellants contend, however, that because the land was registered allegedly by the Island Court, that Court must settle disputes concerning it. This land was registered in 1929 and we question whether the Land Title Registration Act relied upon was in existence in 1929. But there was undoubtedly a system of land registration in existence which was created by the Naval Government. The appellants are in error, however, in any event as there is no contention here that land was registered improperly or that the descriptions are incorrect. The sole contention is that the parties or, more particularly, the appellees are claiming land not included in the description. As this was the contention when the action was started and as the appellants admittedly are not in a position to prove that contention, dismissal for lack of prosecution was clearly indicated. We affirm.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The sole issue raised on appeal is whether defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated when, in his opening statement, the prosecutor made the following reference to Pador\u2019s silence at the time of his arrest :</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b496-3\">. . . The police found the address of Mr. Pador . . . and they went over to see Mr. Pador; to see what he had to contribute, what explanation he could make. The police went to the home of Mr. Pador. He admitted his identity. He made certain admissions under certain circumstances, which will be explained to- you; as a result of which \u2014 and after being warned of his constitutional rights \u2014 remained silent. The police then put him under arrest and took him to [the] Agana Lock-up. (Transcript at 17:21.)</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b496-4\">It is true that a prosecutor may not seek to prove his case by emphasizing the fact that an accused has exercised his fifth amendment rights: either in refusing to take the stand, <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965); <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); or in remaining silent in the face of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240 (1976). However, the court finds in this case that such a minimal reference to an accused\u2019s silence in no way affected the outcome of the case and does not require rev\u00e9rsal.</p>\n    <p id=\"b496-5\">Here, unlike the Supreme Court cases cited above, there was no effort by the prosecution to \u201csolemnize the silence of the accused into evidence against him\u201d <em>(Griffin, </em>380 U.S. 609, 614, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 1233), or to \u201cimpeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial\u201d <em>(Doyle, </em>426 U.S. 610, 617-19). A cursory reading of <em>Chapman, Griffin </em>and <em>Doyle, </em>supra, makes it clear that reversal in these cases was only required where the prosecutor suggested to the jury that failure to take the stand or silence in the face of <em>Miranda </em>warnings was indicative of guilt. In <em>Doyle, </em>the prosecution in an effort to impeach defendants\u2019 testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>that they had been framed belabored the fact that they refused to answer questions after being read their rights:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b497-3\"><em>We have the Fifth Amendment. </em>I agree with it. It is fundamental to our sense and system of fairness,' but <em>if you are </em>innocent\u2014</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b497-4\"><em>(continuing) </em>\u2014 if <em>you are innocent </em>\u2014 Ladies and Gentlemen, if you have been framed, if you have been set-on, etc. etc. etc., as we heard in Court these last days, you don\u2019t say, when the law enforcement officer says, \u2014 \u201cYou are under <em>arrest,\u201d </em>\u2014 you <em>don\u2019t </em>say,\u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about.\u201d <em>You tell the truth. </em>You tell them what happened and you go from there. <em>You don\u2019t </em>say,\u2014 <em>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about,\u201d </em>\u2014 and <em>demand to see your lawyer and refuse to permit a search of your vehicle, forcing the law enforcement agents to get a search warrant.</em></blockquote>\n    <blockquote id=\"b497-5\"><em>If you\u2019re innocent, you just don\u2019t do it. Doyle Tr. 515-516, 519, 526. </em>(426 U.S. 634-36; emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b497-6\">Here the prosecution\u2019s opening statement did not suggest to the jury one way or another that the accused was guilty when he remained silent. The silence of the accused was in no way used to impeach him or to buttress the Government\u2019s case; therefore, we do not have a Doyle-type violation here. The reference to the accused\u2019s silence after being read his rights could not have been taken by the jury as a negative comment on his silence and did not affect the verdict. While the defendant has suggested an emerging rule from other jurisdictions that any \u201cDoyle-type\u201d violation can never be harmless, we choose to accept the rule of the Ninth Circuit that has been established regarding the prosecution\u2019s comments on a defendant\u2019s exercise of his fifth amendment right not to testify. The rule has been generally stated as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b497-7\">The test is whether the language used was <em>manifestly </em>intended or was of such character that the jury would <em>naturally </em>and <em>necessarily </em>have taken it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify. <em>Hayes v. United States, </em>368 F.2d 814, 816 (9th Circuit 1966); <em>Brown v. United States, </em>370 F.2d 874, 876 (9th Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1039, 87 S.Ct. 1494, 18 L.Ed.2d 605 (1967). (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b498-5\">Here, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to defendant Pador\u2019s silence was not intended to raise, nor did it raise, in the jury\u2019s mind a negative inference regarding the exercise of his fifth amendment rights.

Rosario, hereinafter called the defendant, was convicted on May 15, 1967, of the charge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>petty theft, in violation of Section 484 of the Penal Code of Guam, and of the charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, in violation of Section 273a of the Penal Code of Guam. On the first mentioned charge, defendant was sentenced to a jail term of one year, and on the charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, defendant was sentenced to a jail term of two months, to be served concurrently with the first mentioned sentence.</p>\n    <p id=\"b197-3\">Of several assignments of error, the .two which are basic to this appeal are essentially:</p>\n    <p id=\"b197-4\">1. That the evidence does not support the findings of the Trial Court beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    <p id=\"b197-5\">2. That the Island Court of Guam was without jurisdiction to try the defendant for violation of Section 273a, Contributing to the Delinquency of a Minor.</p>\n    <p id=\"b197-6\">Section 273a of the Penal Code of Guam was amended by Public Law 9-8, approved on February 20, 1967, and now reads as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b197-7\">\u201cSection 273a. Contributing. Any person who commits any acts or omits the performance of any duty, which act or omission causes or tends to cause or encourage a child to become in need of the care and protection of the Juvenile Court, shall be guilty of misdemeanor, may be tried for such offense in the Juvenile Court, and upon conviction may be punished by a fine not exceeding $500, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b197-8\">The evidence shows that on March 18, 1967, in the early afternoon \u25a0 the chief witness for the prosecution went to Ipao Beach, accompanied by her husband and three children. While there she heard a vehicle stop not far from where she was sitting and also heard someone call out. Upon turning around she saw a little boy grab her pocketbook and run toward a blue truck. At the trial, the witness stated that she knew the license plate number of the truck, and also identified a photograph of said truck. She testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>that the little boy, who appeared to be between ten and twelve years of age, jumped into the truck and that the truck pulled away very quickly. She further testified that the truck was being driven by someone other than the boy who had taken her pocketbook, and that her pocketbook had contained $215.00 in cash and other personal property.</p>\n    <p id=\"b198-5\">Testimony of the other witnesses was that the defendant, an adult, accompanied by three boys, one of which was twelve years of age and another sixteen years of age (the age of the third boy does not appear in the transcript of the trial), went in a truck owned by the father of the three boys and being driven by one of the boys, to Ipao Beach. While there, the youngest boy, Anthony, took the subject purse and jumped into the truck where the defendant, Edward D. Rosario, was sitting in the front seat. The defendant and the three boys proceeded to Harmon Field where the defendant opened the purse, distributed the money between himself and the three boys and threw the purse away. Later, after being apprehended by the police, defendant voluntarily directed the police to the vicinity of where the purse was thrown away, the purse was found, and the defendant identified it. Testimony of the youngest boy, Anthony, was that the defendant told him to take the purse.</p>\n    <p id=\"b198-6\">This Court has repeatedly held that we will not disturb the findings of the lower court if there is credible evidence to support .the judgment. <em>Pangelinan v. Government of Guam, </em>Appeal No. CR. 33-A(1965). In this case we have no doubt as to the correctness of the trial court\u2019s judgment on both counts of the information. It is clear from the evidence that the defendant did participate in the commission of the offense and that his participation was in furtherance of the offense.</p>\n    <p id=\"b199-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>As to defendant\u2019s contention that the Island Court of Guam was without jurisdiction to try the defendant for violation of Section 273a, defendant takes the position that Section 266 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Guam places exclusive jurisdiction in the Juvenile Court. Section 266 reads as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b199-3\">\u201cJurisdiction over adults. The court shall have original jurisdiction to try any adult with a violation of Section 273 (a) of the Penal Code of Guam.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b199-4\">We are of the opinion that the rule ,to be applied in this case is the rule which is constantly applied to ordinary acts of legislation, in which the grant of jurisdiction over a certain subject matter to one court does not, of itself, imply that that jurisdiction is to be exclusive. <em>Bors v. Preston, </em>4 S.Ct. 407, 409, III U.S. 252. The phrase \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d means the power to entertain cases in the first instance as distinguished from appellate jurisdiction, and does not mean exclusive jurisdiction. <em>Burks v. Walker, </em>109 P. 544, 545. If the Legislature had intended such jurisdiction to be exclusive, it would have said so. By its use of the word \u201coriginal\u201d we must conclude that the Juvenile Court\u2019s jurisdiction over adults is concurrent with that of the Island Court of Guam.</p>\n    <p id=\"b199-5\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Santos, hereafter called the defendant, was charged in the Island Court of Guam with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>the offenses of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of \u00a7 23405(a) of the Government Code of Guam, and reckless driving, causing bodily injury to a person, in violation of \u00a7 23407(a) and (b) of such Code. He was acquitted of the charge of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor and found guilty of the charge of reckless driving, causing a bodily injury. As the penalty imposed by the court was well within the limits for reckless driving, regardless of bodily injury, we consider only the reckless driving aspects. The defendant contends on appeal that the evidence did not support the conviction. We review the evidence upon which the trial court could have relied to support the conviction. As we are convinced that such evidence was sufficient we affirm.</p>\n    <p id=\"b430-5\">Before the accident the defendant had been drinking. The doctor who examined him at Guam Memorial Hospital after the accident was prevented from making a thorough examination because the defendant became violent, but the doctor testified that he noticed the smell of alcohol very strong (Tr. p. 2). The police officer who investigated the accident testified that the defendant had alcohol on his breath and the police officer ordered a sobriety examination (Tr. p. 21).</p>\n    <p id=\"b430-6\">While the mere act of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor is not in itself a sufficient predicate for a conviction of reckless driving the fact that one charged with reckless driving had been drinking is a factor to be considered in determining his guilt, and evidence of such drinking is generally recognized as being admissible in a prosecution for reckless driving. 7 Am.Jur.2d 879.</p>\n    <p id=\"b430-7\">The defendant and his passenger had attended some racing at Harmon Air Strip when it started to rain and the defendant drove onto the highway, was in the middle lane and \u201cI just miss the car was beside me when I pass him and went inside the first lane\u201d (Defendant\u2019s testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Tr. p. 30). The car the defendant just missed was apparently being driven by People\u2019s witness Bias who testified that he was traveling in a solid-line lane which extended for some distance when he was passed by the defendant. A solid line on this three-lane highway means that traffic must travel in the lane to the right of the solid line, leaving the other two lanes for traffic from the opposite direction and for passing in the middle lane when so marked. Before he reached the Cycle Center in Tamuning the defendant skidded but did not hit anybody (Tr. p. 13). He skidded to the other side of the road on the shoulder. The witness continued his driving when he saw the defendant coming again. The witness passed three cars in front of him to get away from the defendant. The defendant also passed these cars, skidded in the middle lane and hit another car that was waiting to make a left-hand turn (Tr. p. 14). When the defendant first passed the witness he was going 50, 60 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone (Tr. p. 15). The car waiting to turn had been there for about three minutes. After the accident the defendant appeared to be boxing an invisible opponent in his car (Tr. p. 9). The defendant and his passenger were taken to the hospital in an ambulance when the events previously mentioned took place. The defendant was given sedation and, no injuries being found, he was taken to the police station. At the police station the defendant had difficulty speaking and \u201cMr. Santos was crawling up to his wife and was groaning and under the alcohol beverage, coming from his breath to strong alcohol\u201d (Tr. p. 21).</p>\n    <p id=\"b431-3\">From the totality of the evidence, then, the trial court could find (1) the defendant had been drinking; (2) he passed and just missed another car while going above the speed limit on a wet highway, crossing a solid line in the process; (3) some distance farther on went into a skid to the other side of the highway; (4) did not enter the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>traffic <em>lane </em>but continued in the center lane while passing other automobiles; (5) could not control his car and went into another skid into the right rear of a car waiting to turn, a car that had been there for some time; (6) subsequent actions consistent with an effort to avoid a sobriety test.</p>\n    <p id=\"b432-5\">Section 23407 of the Government Code of Guam provides that a defendant to be guilty of reckless driving must drive a vehicle in wilful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property. We are cited to a number of California decisions by the defendant and the People in connection with the construction of these words. This opinion would be unnecessarily long if we attempted to discuss the various distinctions involved in terms of the large number of decisions. As the defendant has relied upon the following case in support of his position, we quote from it as controlling here.</p>\n    <p id=\"b432-6\">While, however, for the reasons stated, the contentions embraced in the defendant\u2019s first three specifications of error appear to us to be without substance, it is otherwise with the fourth specification, namely, that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the judgment. There is no dispute that passengers in the defendant\u2019s car were injured in the accident under investigation. We do not doubt that the defendant\u2019s conduct in weaving back and forth while on a grade, from one traffic lane to the other, taken together with the physical facts disclosed in the evidence, particularly the appearance and length of the skid marks on the road, and the place where his automobile came to rest, made out a prima facie case of negligence and possibly of gross negligence on his part. It was open to the defendant, of course, to show that what happened was attributable to mechanical defects in his automobile or other circumstances beyond his control. The explanation which he attempted was met by other testimony which produced a conflict. This conflict the trial court resolved against the defendant. We must, therefore, for the purpose of the present decision, assume that he was guilty of negligence, and may for the sake of the argument assume that it amounted to gross negligence. This, however, is not enough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>to warrant conviction of the violation of \u00a7 505(b) of the Vehicle Code. It was held in the recent case of <em>People v. McNutt, </em>Cal. Super., 105 P.2d 657, that there is no substantial difference between \u201cwilful misconduct\u201d, as used in \u00a7 403 of the Vehicle Code, which renders a driver liable for injuries to his guest, and \u201creckless driving\u201d as defined in \u00a7 505 of said Code and that decisions construing the term \u201cwilful misconduct\u201d may be applied to the statutory provision prohibiting \u201creckless driving\u201d; and that negligence, even though gross, is not \u201cwilful misconduct\u201d and falls short of constituting \u201creckless driving.\u201d Without elaborating upon the comprehensive discussion in the opinion in that case, we content ourselves with saying that we agree with the views there expressed.</p>\n    <p id=\"b433-3\">In the instant case there is nothing to show that the defendant was guilty of \u201cdeliberate, intentional, or wanton conduct in doing or omitting to perform acts, with knowledge or appreciation of the fact, on the part of the culpable person, that danger\u201d was \u201clikely to result therefrom\u201d which is the test of the existence or nonexistence of \u201cwilful misconduct\u201d as laid down in <em>Parsons v. Fuller, </em>8 Cal.2d 463, 468, 66 P.2d 430, 432. In these circumstances he was not shown to be guilty of \u201creckless driving.\u201d <em>People v. Thompson, </em>41 Cal. App. 2d Supp. 965, 108 P.2d 105, 107 (App. Dept. S.Ct. 1940).</p>\n    <p id=\"b433-4\">We hold that when a drinking and speeding defendant on a wet highway has faced one skid which threw his car in front of any traffic coming from the opposite direction, who then continues the same driving pattern until another skid forced his vehicle into collision with a standing car waiting to make a left turn, certainly had knowledge or appreciation of the fact on his part that danger was likely to result therefrom and that he drove his vehicle upon a highway in wilful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.

The petition for registration as it relates to Lot No. 2422, was opposed by Maria C. Taitano, daughter of the alleged owner of Lot No. 2421, on the ground that Lot No. 2422 encroaches upon Lot No. 2421.</p>\n    <p id=\"b175-7\">Ensuing the submission of evidence by the petitioners (appellants) and respondent (appellee), the court granted the application on petition for registration or certification of title to Lot No. 2429, but denied registration or certification of title to Lot No. 2422. The Court held that the petitioners failed to offer proof that they possessed the claimed interest by production of the regular chain of conveyance or by title to adverse possession, or by evidence establishing their interest as against the world. On the basis of the foregoing reasons coupled with the Court\u2019s finding of latent ambiguity or uncertainty as to the disputed boundary line between Lot No. 2422 and Lot No. 2421, the petition for registration of title to Lot No. 2422 was denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b175-8\">The appellants predicated their claim of ownership of the lands by virtue of intestate succession and subsequent deeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>of partition entered by and among the heirs. The proofs presented to the Court disclosed that Lot No. 2422 is a portion of Estate No. 123, first recorded on May 24,1895 with possessory title vested in Dionicio de Salas Y Aguon, and by subsequent conveyances, ownership or possession became vested in the Estate of Manuela Cruz Salas, deceased; that said land measured 200 meters in length from east to west, and 90 meters in width from north to south, equivalent to an area of one hectare 80 ares, and that it was bounded on the <em>west </em>by the land of Ignacio de la Cruz. All deeds of conveyances subsequent to the original recording bear no description of the property other than a mere reference to the description shown in the first recorded document. A map prepared by a licensed surveyor for appellants was presented to the Court showing the metes and bounds description of Lot No. 2422. The map was admitted in evidence, and such became the basis of the appellants\u2019 contention that sufficient proof had been offered to establish their rights to have title to Lot No. 2422 registered in their names. It was only through this map that a definite description of the boundary lines of Lot No. 2422 was shown for the first time.</p>\n    <p id=\"b176-5\">The appellants, however, have utterly failed to show the basis of the surveyor\u2019s affixation of the boundary line of Lot No. 2422 and Lot No. 2421, other than the prof erred testimony of the surveyor that he found a pre-war monument on the east side of an old bull cart trail between Lots 2429 and 2430, and that he obtained the given description from certain Naval Government information under date of March 11,1937. The mere translation of certain descriptions from an assumed Naval Government map, to an on-the-ground monumentation absent any proof of the authenticity of such map, its official standing, and its accuracy, leaves much to be desired as to its probative value. In our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>opinion the fact that a survey was made as hereinabove stated does not, in and by itself, lend substance ,to appellants\u2019 contention that they have sustained the burden of proving their title to Lot No. 2422. We, therefore, concur with the Island Court that appellants had failed to offer the necessary proof which will entitle them to a decree of registration.</p>\n    <p id=\"b177-3\">We also concur with the Court\u2019s holding that certain ambiguity or uncertainty existed as to the disputed common boundary line of Lot No. 2422 and Lot No. 2421.</p>\n    <p id=\"b177-4\">The records of the Department of Land Management disclosed that Lot No. 2421, the land, allegedly owned by the father of the appellee, was bounded on the <em>East </em>by property belonging to the Estate of Francisco Gumataotao, and not by Lot No. 2422, thus negating appellants\u2019 contention that Lot No. 2422 was bounded on the West by Lot No. 2421. Contrariwise, other Land Management records, showed that Lot No. 2422 was bounded on the <em>West </em>by the property of appellee, as was contended by the appellants. The appellants, however, failed to explain to the satisfaction of the Court this obvious discrepancy of abutting property owners which is really one of the basic factors determinant of the common boundary line of Lot No. 2422 and Lot No. 2421.</p>\n    <p id=\"b177-5\">It is relevant ,to note at this point that the findings of the trial Court did not determine one way or the other the alleged encroachment of Lot No. 2422 upon Lot No. 2421, which is the contention of the appellee, and which is the basis of her objection to the granting of registration of title to Lot No. 2422.</p>\n    <p id=\"b177-6\">While the Island Court properly denied the petition for registration of title to Lot No. 2422, such denial should not be conversely construed as a holding by the Court that Lot No. 2422 encroaches upon Lot No. 2421 in the absence of any specific finding.</p>\n    <p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>On the basis of the foregoing we can reach no other conclusion than to affirm the judgment of the trial Court.</p>\n    <p id=\"ArU\">We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

BRAMHALL: No, I don\u2019t think that. No. I certainly don\u2019t think that and as I said I \u2014 as I began the remarks, <em>we do want the wife to have </em>alimony . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) (Transcript P. 1683.)</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b246-10\">Later on in his closing remarks counsel reiterated in even more positive terms, his client\u2019s belief that the wife receive support:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b246-11\">\u201cYour Honor, I believe that justice and the law require that a divorce be granted on the grounds of extreme cruelty; that custody be granted to the father upon such liberal term as the court feels should be imposed. <em>That the mother be granted support\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b246-12\">The interlocutory decree as thereafter entered, awarded the husband custody of two minor children, divided the community assets, required that the husband maintain two (2) twenty thousand dollar ($20,000) life insurance policies on his life naming his former wife irrevocable beneficiary, and ordered him to pay $500.00 per month \u201cfor her permanent support and maintenance . .. until further order of a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n    <p id=\"b247-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Cross appeals were taken to the Appellate Division, District Court of Guam, the wife contesting both the jurisdiction of the lower court and its judgment awarding custody of the children to the husband, the husband challenging the division of the community property and the requirement that he be compelled to maintain the two life insurance policies. No appeal was taken from the portion of the interlocutory decree awarding support to the wife. On May 10, 1973 the Appellate Court affirmed the jurisdiction of the lower court and its decision as ,to the custody of the children and remanded the question of the division of the community property, finding that the trial court had awarded the wife more than 50 % of the community property in violation of Guam Civil Code \u00a7 146.</p>\n    <p id=\"b247-3\">On June 11, 1973 defendant wife appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit which affirmed the lower court. <em>Leo C. Lewis v. Zell S. Lewis, </em>February 26, 1974, Slip Opinion No. 73-2474.</p>\n    <p id=\"b247-4\">In September 1973, and during the pendency of the above appeal, plaintiff discontinued making his support payments and noticed a motion to vacate the portion of the interlocutory decree ordering payment of support. The matter was heard on the 20th of October and denied on the 1st day of November 1973. The appeal before us here is from the order denying the motion to vacate.</p>\n    <p id=\"b247-5\">Appellant urges a strict interpretation of Guam Civil Code \u00a7 139<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and argues that this case is controlled by <em>Hager v. Hager, </em>199 C.A.2d 259, 18 Cal.Rptr. 695 (1962); <em>Carr v. Carr, </em>165 C.A.2d 568, 332 P.2d 185 (1958); <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number><em>Spencer, </em>83 Cal. 460, 23 P. 395 (1890); and <em>Marrs v. Superior Court, </em>137 C.A. 579, 30 P.2d 1030 (1934).</p>\n    <p id=\"b248-4\">It is true that Guam Civil Code \u00a7 139 is identical to California Civil Code \u00a7 139 and that where such identity exists, decisions of the Supreme Court of California are accepted as precedent for interpreting the statutes of Guam, <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>181 F.2d 572 (9th Cir. 1950). However, while accepted as precedent, they are far from binding and particularly where the California decisions have been rendered after .the adoption of the Guam Statute, in which case they are held to be merely \u201cpersuasive.\u201d <em>Tabor v. Ulloa, </em>323 F.2d 823 (9th Cir. 1963).</p>\n    <p id=\"b248-5\">Assuming arguendo that a strict application of California law as interpreted by the Supreme Court is required here<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellant still fails to demonstrate error on the part of the trial court.</p>\n    <p id=\"b248-6\"><em>In re Spencer </em>does contain language that allowance for alimony \u201c. . . cannot be made when the divorce is granted for the offense of the wife \u2014 only when it is for an offense of the husband . . . .\u201d However the case was a proceeding on habeas corpus and stands only for the proposition that the lower court had jurisdiction to compel a husband who was the wrongdoer, to make support payments to his divorced wife, even though the divorce decree had erroneously characterized the payments as \u201cpermanent alimony.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n    <p id=\"b248-7\">The <em>Marrs </em>case is not a decision of the State Supreme Court and thus imposes no precedential constraint on this court. Furthermore, while similar in some respects to the facts of this case, and favorable ,to appellant\u2019s position, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>was decided in 1934 before many subsequent California cases which have substantially eroded the strict application of the general rule sought here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Hager v. Hager </em>also lacks the clout of a Supreme Court ruling. Furthermore it ipisses the mark, for unlike the case at bar, there was no promise or stipulation on the part of Mr. Hager to support his divorced wife.</p>\n    <p id=\"b249-3\"><em>Carr v. Carr </em>enumerates the many exceptions' to the strict rule which California courts have fashioned over the years, and quotes at length from a Maine case<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which, in enforcing a promise to pay alimony to a divorced wife, turns <em>not </em>narrowly on the \u201calimony-as-part-of-a-property-settlement\u201d device but on the point that the law neither prohibits the parties from entering into a proper agreement in reference to alimony nor forbids the court from rendering a judgment in accordance with that agreement. The Maine court properly points out that no agreement could vest it with jurisdiction where none had been conferred upon it by the legislature, but went on to say that since the court had \u201cpower to adjudge concerning the general question [i.e., of divorce and alimony] involved\u201d the consent of the parties authorizes the court to render a valid judgment in accordance therewith.</p>\n    <p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Admittedly, the <em>Carr </em>case itself recites the standard jurisdiction-through-property-settlement litany but the court\u2019s acceptance of the more persuasive logic of the <em>Stratton </em>decision rings loud and clear.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n    <p id=\"b250-5\">This court believes that there are other compelling reasons for enforcing stipulations and promises made in open court. It is sheer nonsense to say that stipulations and promises should not \u2014 or do not \u2014 have any impact on the trier of fact, be it judge or jury, and that they should not\u2014 or do not \u2014 in some way, either directly or indirectly, affect the outcome of the trial. To permit the parties and counsel to offer such promises and stipulations in the belief that they are unenforceable and can be subsequently rejected out of hand would seriously undermine a judge\u2019s ability to properly conduct the business of his court. Certainly if a stipulation were in error or beyond the power of counsel, prompt corrective steps can and should be taken. Furthermore, if a judgment is alleged to be invalid due to improper reliance on a stipulation, appeal is the proper remedy. If reversed the trial judge can again consider the case as a whole. But what plaintiff seeks here, is to have the full case to go to final judgment and then, twenty-seven (27) months after its original entry carve out those portions which impose a burden on him. This court is not in a position to speculate whether we have arrived at this point through a deliberate ruse or an innocent mistake, but regardless of which it is it is not difficult to imagine the many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>injustices which could he perpetrated upon litigants and courts alike if such a practice were permitted.</p>\n    <p id=\"b251-3\">The court is informed that both parties now reside in California. Furthermore it is not unmindful that the changing attitude in California, as well as elsewhere, towards woman\u2019s rights and obligations in modern society has affected the amount and duration of alimony being awarded by the courts.</p>\n    <p id=\"b251-4\">And while we are in no position to pass on the merits of the continuation or modification of alimony in the instant case, it seems appropriate to point out that both by the terms of the decree and by the application of general law either party may petition the California courts for such review and modification as they believe is appropriate. <em>Worthley v. Worthley, </em>44 C.A.2d 465, 283 P.2d 19 (1955).</p>\n    <p id=\"b251-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n      <p id=\"b247-6\"> \u00a7 139. <em>Family support. </em>When a dissolution of marriage is granted for an offense of the husband, the court may compel him to provide for the maintenance of the children of the marriage, and to make such suitable allowance to the wife for her support, during her life, or for a shorter period, as the court may deem just, having regard to the circumstances of the parties respectively; and the court may, from time to time, modify its orders in these respects. [Enacted 1953.]</p>\n    </footnote>\n    <footnote label=\"2\">\n      <p id=\"b248-8\"> The court takes judicial notice that in 1969 California abandoned the fault concept for adjudication of such matters as dissolution of a marriage and the award of support. California Civil Code \u00a7\u00a7 4502, 4506, 4507, 4509, 4801.</p>\n    </footnote>\n    <footnote label=\"3\">\n      <p id=\"b248-10\"> The California Statute only used the term \u201calimony\u201d in regards to payments pendente lite. <em>Post </em>divorce payments were referred to as \u201c. . . suitable allowance to the wife for her support... .\u201d</p>\n    </footnote>\n    <footnote label=\"4\">\n      <p id=\"b249-4\"> For example: In <em>DeBurgh v. DeBurgh, </em>39 C.2d 858, 250 P.2d 598 the Supreme Court relaxed the rule by saying alimony could be ordered paid to a guilty wife when the husband was equally guilty and subject to being divorced. And in <em>Mueller v. Mueller, </em>44 C.2d 257, 282 P.2d 869 at 871 (1955) Justice Traynor, writing for a divided court rejected the type of rigidity appellant would have us adopt here and cites with approval a number of cases in other jurisdictions which allow alimony to a divorced wife.</p>\n      <p id=\"b249-6\">\u201cThey counsel the wisdom of caution before adopting any arbitrary rule that would fetter discretion and require the trial court to deny alimony merely because the wife has been guilty of adultery. As pointed out by the Supreme Court of Utah in dealing with a similar problem, \u2018Great caution is necessary to prevent the contentions and strife which frequently exist in contested divorce cases from distorting the judgment by placing extraordinary emphasis on particular instances of blameworthy conduct or some unusual sacrifice or contribution in some one phase of the over-all picture.\u2019 <em>MacDonald v. MacDonald, . . </em>. 236 P.2d 1066, 1069. It certainly does not comport with good conscience to turn such an unfortunate individual out to fend for herself after having given 29 years to this marriage, good or bad as her conduct may have been.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n    </footnote>\n    <footnote label=\"5\">\n      <p id=\"b249-7\"> <em>Stratton v. Stratton, </em>77 Me. 373, 36 A.2d 773.</p>\n    </footnote>\n    <footnote label=\"6\">\n      <p id=\"b250-6\"> The court also quotes at length from <em>Stratton </em>which recites additional equitable rationale for its ruling. At 775 of 36 A.2d:</p>\n      <blockquote id=\"b250-7\">\u201cIt is difficult to conceive of more compelling particular circumstances justifying the employment of the exception to the general rule than when, with the parties before the Court, there is a noncollusive, court-approved agreement as to alimony, perhaps then acceded to by the husband because he believes that it is only fair and just that following the separation she have such support, which he is willing to provide, and especially when she may have no other means due to age, poor health, or some other cause. She may believe she could prevail in a contest, but desists in reliance upon his valid promise. He obtains his divorce. Afterwards he breaks his word. Should the Court shield him in such reprehensible act and deny her the agreed-upon subsistence because he obtained his divorce for her fault?\u201d</blockquote>\n    </footnote>\n  </opinion>\n  <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n    <author id=\"b251-6\">BENSON, <em>Designated Judge,</em></author>\n    <p id=\"ACu\">concurring.</p>\n    <p id=\"b251-7\">The appellant\u2019s motion to vacate the support provisions constitutes a direct attack on the interlocutory decree of divorce.</p>\n    <p id=\"b251-8\">The court had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject matter of the action, the marriage res. Because of statute (Section 139 of the Civil Code) and decisional restraint (e.g., <em>Atendido v. Atendido </em>(1974), District Court of Guam Appellate Division Case No. 94-A), the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to award alimony to the guilty wife. Such award was in excess of the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n    <p id=\"b251-9\">Since subject matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred by the consent of the parties, the issue presented by this appeal is whether or not the appellant has standing to complain of the alimony award.</p>\n    <p id=\"b251-10\">The trial court properly denied the appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n    <p id=\"b251-11\">The appellant is precluded from objecting to the alimony award after he twice asserted during trial his wish that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>appellee be granted alimony. The opinion in this case on page 7 forcefully sets forth the effect of such representations on the trial court. That the appellant should thereafter be estopped from complaining when the court took the action which the appellant invited is directly supported by authority. <em>In re Griffin </em>(1967), 67 C.2d 343, at p. 348, 62 C.R. 1, 431 P.2d 625; <em>City of Los Angeles v. Cole </em>(1946), 28 C.2d 509, at p. 515, 170 P.2d 982; 1 Witkins, California Procedure, Second Edition, pp. 756-759. Such estoppel is necessary in this case for the proper functioning of the court. \u201cTo hold otherwise would permit the parties to trifle with the courts. The law should not and in our opinion does not countenance such action.\u201d <em>City of Los Angeles v. Cole, </em>supra, 28 C.2d, atp. 515.</p>\n    <p id=\"b252-5\">In <em>Seymour v. Seymour </em>(1937), 18 Cal.App.2d 481, 64 P.2d 168, the husband moved to eliminate that portion of the interlocutory decree which granted alimony to the guilty wife. At the trial the parties had introduced a property settlement with alimony for the wife. The court held that having invoked the jurisdiction of the court the husband was not later entitled to contend that the judgment in regard to alimony was invalid.</p>\n    <p id=\"b252-6\"><em>Frank v. Frank </em>(1969), 275 Cal.App.2d 717, 80 Cal.Rptr. 141, is remarkably similar to the instant case. The husband collaterally attacked the provision in the interlocutory and final decrees for alimony of a fixed sum payable for a four year period \u201cirrespective of remarriage\u201d. The contention of lack of jurisdiction under Section 139 of the California Civil Code was raised after the wife remarried within the four year period. Section 139 provided that unless agreed to in writing, alimony terminated upon remarriage. The alimony provision for a fixed period had been stipulated to at trial, but was not in writing, and the provision \u201cirrespective of remarriage\u201d was included in the interlocutory and final decrees. Aware of the provision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>the husband had not raised the issue in his appeal because he considered it void. The court held that the trial court\u2019s decree was in excess of the jurisdiction, but that the husband had no standing to raise .the question by collateral attack where the court had fundamental jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter. The court pointed out (as the opinion does in the instant case) that had the point been raised on appeal, the trial court could have, on remand, reconsidered the case as a whole. The husband\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court of California was denied.</p>\n    <p id=\"b253-3\">For the above reasons, the order denying appellant\u2019s motion should be affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

The Guam Legislature vested jurisdiction in the Island Court of Guam just as comparable jurisdiction is vested in the Federal District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Courts under the Harbor Workers\u2019 Act and since this and the Guam Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act are substantially the same, it is possible to rely upon United States cases in construing the Guam Act.</p>\n    <p id=\"b94-5\">The appellant contends that summary judgment was improperly granted if any questions of fact remained to be determined by the Island Court. The Rules of the Island Court follow the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. We agree that if any questions of fact remained to be determined in the Island Court, summary judgment is not permitted. This is illustrated by the recent case of <em>Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. </em>(1962) 368 U.S. 464:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b94-6\">\u201cSummary judgment should be entered only when the pleadings, depositions, affidavits, and admissions filed in the case \u2018show that [except as to the amount of damages] there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 Rule 56(c), Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. This rule authorizes summary judgment \u2018only where the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, where it is quite clear what the truth is, . . . [and where] no genuine issue remains for trial . . . [for] the purpose of the rule is not to cut litigants off from their right of trial by jury if they really have issues to try.\u2019 <em>Sartor v. Arkansas Natural Gas Corp., </em>321 U.S. 620, 627 (1944). We now examine the contention of the parties to determine whether under the rule summary judgment was proper.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b94-7\">It will be noted, however, that under the provisions of Section 37021(b), the Island Court is given jurisdiction to suspend or set aside, in whole or in part, the determinations made by the Commissioner only \u201cif not in accordance with the law.\u201d The factual questions are to be determined by the Commissioner. The review responsibility of the Island Court is limited to a determination as to whether there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s findings. It is not contended in this case that any jurisdictional question existed. The Island Court had before it the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>upon which the Commissioner based his findings. This record was attached to the amended complaint. The question as to whether that record contained substantial evidence upon which the findings were based was presented through the submission of briefs, so that the Island Court, before it granted summary judgment, had before it everything upon which it could base its determination. It must be pointed out that under its review function the Island Court is not given authority to substitute its judgment for that of the Commissioner. If substantial evidence does not exist to support the award, the Island Court is authorized so to find as a matter of law. A case which arose in Guam, but which was not presented to Guam courts, involved an award to the mother of a deceased employee of Brown-Pacific-Maxon, Inc. This employee was on a recreational beach maintained by the employer when he heard cries of \"help\u201d from two men standing on the reef. The deceased was drowned as he attempted to reach these men. An award was made, and a petition was filed in the District Court to set aside the award. The District Court denied the petition upon the ground that there was substantial evidence to sustain the compensation order. This denial was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and was reversed, 182 F.2d 772. The Court of Appeals was of the view that the death was entirely disconnected from the employment. The Court of Appeals was reversed. In <em>O\u2019Leary v. </em>Brown-Pacific-Maxon, 340 U.S. 504, the Supreme Court stated, p. 508:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b95-3\">\u201cWe are satisfied that the record supports the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s finding. The pertinent evidence was presented by the written statements of four persons and the testimony of one witness. It is, on the whole, consistent and credible. From it the Deputy Commissioner could rationally infer that Valak acted reasonably in attempting to rescue, and that his death may fairly be attributable to the risks of the employment. We do not mean that the evidence compelled this inference; <em>we do not suggest that had the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number><em>Deputy Commissioner decided against the claimant, a court would have been justified in disturbing his conclusion. </em>We hold only that on this record the decision of the District Court that the award should not be set aside should be sustained.\u201d (Italics supplied.)</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b96-5\">The case of <em>Colonna\u2019s Shipyard v. O\u2019Hearne, </em>200 F.2d 220 is illustrative of the case which is now before us. A 63-year-old workman turned his left ankle in the course of his employment and felt pain, but did not twist or strain or injure his knee. Subsequently a thrombus developed, as a result of which the leg was amputated above the knee. A compensation award was made, sustained by the District Court, and appealed to the Court of Appeals. The appeals court was careful to trace a medical history which showed that the worker had knowingly suffered from an auricular fibrillation and that this condition not infrequently causes emboli or clots to form on the walls of the chamber of the heart which may move through the arterial system to the brain and cause cerebral thrombosis; or, on the other hand, may move to the other extremity of the body and there give rise to an arterial obstruction which may result in gangrene and necessitate an amputation. The Court concluded that there was not substantial evidence to support the award and stated at page 223:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b96-6\">\u201cThe record contains no qualification or contradiction of this testimony. It is true that the diagnosis of the injury is not susceptible of absolute certainty and that the formation of a spontaneous clot in the vascular system of an aged person through a local trauma is a possibility; but in this case the source of the trouble was definitely located by the pathological examination at the knee and not at the ankle, and the evidence shows that the obstruction was sufficient to account for the pain which the claimant first noticed when working on the ship.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b96-7\">In the instant case practically undisputed evidence shows that a 42-year-old Filipino employee was engaged in lifting a tilt cylinder of a forklift when he suffered a cere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>bral thrombosis caused by an aggravation of a previously-existing arterial disease. The weight of the tilt cylinder was approximately 34 pounds and two persons were engaged in moving it. The weight being lifted was much less than the maximum weight which a workman could ordinarily lift with complete safety. The Commissioner found from the medical evidence that there was a pre-existing arterial disease. However, as differentiated from the medical evidence in the <em>O\u2019Hearm </em>case, the medical evidence showed that there was a direct causal connection between the lifting and the formation of the thrombus. Dr. Dwight Dill stated, in part, as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote id=\"b97-3\">\u201cThe other possibility of slowing of the cerebral circulation is quite pertinent in this case in that the lifting of an object, even one weighing only 17 pounds, causes a contraction of the abdominal muscles which places force upon the internal organs of the abdomen ; this force on the abdominal organs results in a blockage of the out-flow of venous blood from the cerebrospinal venous system thereby resulting in a slowing of the movement of blood or a spasm of the blood vessels of the cerebrovascular system. This type of reaction is familiar to each of us in the form of slight dizziness or lightheadedness which accompanies a violent attack of sneezing, coughing or undue straining during a bowel movement. It is therefore quite possible that the precipitating factor in this man\u2019s cerebral thrombosis was that of lifting an object resulting in tension of the abdomen and thereby slowing the cerebral blood flow sufficiently to permit the already existent partial occlusion to be rendered a complete occlusion by blood coagulation around the plaque or fibrotic area in the cerebral vessel.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p id=\"b97-4\">The Commissioner had substantial evidence to justify his findings that the lifting of the weight precipitated the cerebral thrombosis.</p>\n    <p id=\"b97-5\">As pointed out above, the limited review function does not permit the Court to substitute its judgment for that of the Commissioner. There was nothing for the Commissioner to answer and he chose to move for summary judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>The same results would have been reached if he had moved to deny the relief sought. We must not confuse summary judgment in this case with summary judgment in the ordinary adversary proceeding. In affirming, we wish to express our thanks for the briefs that were submitted both to the Island Court and to this Court. It may well be that the injured workman would have suffered the same inevitable result regardless of any causal connection with his employment, but the fact remains that the end result was precipitated by the lifting in which he was engaged at the time of his collapse. Affirmed.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

ANNA R. GRAVES, et al., Defendants</parties>\n  <docketnumber id=\"b606-11\">Civil Case No. 609-78</docketnumber>\n  <court id=\"AhPF\">Superior Court of Guam</court>\n  <decisiondate id=\"AOT\">September 1, 1978</decisiondate>\n  <opinion type=\"majority\">\n    <author id=\"b607-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>WEEKS, <em>Judge</em></author>\n    <p id=\"b607-6\">DECISION</p>\n    <p id=\"b607-7\">This case comes before the Court on plaintiff Hawaiian Life Insurance Company\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction, dismissal of plaintiff and award of attorney fees. The motion was filed on August 21, 1978, and argued September 1, 1978. During the September 1 hearing this Court held that there were adverse claimants to the fund deposited and that interpleader pursuant to Rule 22 was proper.</p>\n    <p id=\"b607-8\">Initially, it should be noted that prior to the adoption of the Guam Rules of Civil Procedure, interpleader actions were controlled by Civil Procedure Code \u00a7 386. After the adoption of the Rules of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 386 is of no further effect to the extent that its provisions conflict with Rule 22. See Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 123. Examination of Rule 22 and \u00a7 386 indicates that they are not in conflict as they relate to this action.</p>\n    <p id=\"b607-9\">Plaintiff seeks to enjoin defendants from instituting or prosecuting any action in another court which would affect the subject matter of this action. This Court finds no legal basis for the granting of such injunctive relief.</p>\n    <p id=\"b607-10\">Had plaintiff been able to proceed in Federal District Court pursuant to the Federal Interpleader Statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (28 U.S.C. Sections 1335, 1397, 2361) or Rule interpleader under Rule 22 such relief would have been available. In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>junctions against state court actions are provided for by \u00a7 2361 (statutory interpleader) and \u00a7 2283 (rule inter-pleader) of Title 28. However, interpleader in Guam is based on Civil Procedure Code \u00a7 386. That Section has been adopted from California and the courts of that state have never recognized the use of injunctions in interpleader actions. Additionally, Federal Court injunctions are directed at court proceedings rather than individuals.</p>\n    <p id=\"b608-5\">Plaintiff also seeks an order dismissing it from this action. As previously noted, this Court held on September 1, 1978, that interpleader was proper procedure under the facts of this case. The fund at issue was deposited with the Clerk of Courts on August 15, 1978. Under these circumstances, plaintiff is entitled to be discharged from liability and freed from the necessity of participating in the litigation between the claimants. See generally <em>Hancock Oil Company v. Hopkins, </em>24 Cal.2d 497, 150 P.2d 463 (1944); <em>Williams v. Gilmore, </em>51 Cal.App.2d 684, 125 P.2d 539 (1942).</p>\n    <p id=\"b608-6\">Finally, plaintiff seeks attorney fees. Historically, federal equity courts have awarded attorney fees to the stakeholder if circumstances made such an award appropriate. <em>Thomas Kay Woolen Mill Co. v. Sprague, </em>259 F. 388 (1919); <em>McNamara v. Provident Sav. Life Assur. Soc., </em>114 F. 910 (1902). Federal Courts have continued this practice under Rule 22 and the interpleader statutes although fees are not expressly allowed. <em>Davis v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>331 F.2d 346 (1964). <em>Globe Indemnity Co. v. Puget Sound Co., </em>154 F.2d 249 (1946).</p>\n    <p id=\"b608-7\">The California Supreme Court ruled in 1939 that the allowance of attorney fees to the stakeholder was without authority. <em>Pacific Gas and Electric Co. v. Nakano, </em>12 Cal.2d 711, 87 P.2d 700 (1939). The appellate courts have consistently recognized that California cases subsequent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>the adoption of the Guam Codes, while not binding, are persuasive. <em>Tabor v. Ulloa, </em>323 F.2d 823, 824, n.5 (9th Cir. 1963); <em>Roberto v. Aguon, </em>519 F.2d 754 (9th Cir. 1975). It is unclear whether the Federal view or the California position<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is preferable and should be adopted. Therefore, this Court holds only that attorney fees will not be awarded in this action.</p>\n    <p id=\"b609-3\">For the foregoing reasons plaintiff\u2019s motion is granted as to dismissal and denied as to the injunction and attorney fees.</p>\n    <p id=\"b609-4\">Plaintiff to submit order.</p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n      <p id=\"b607-11\"> It is not immediately clear that such jurisdiction would lie in the District Court of Guam since 28 U.S.C. Section 1335 creates a remedy only and suits thereunder may not \u201carise under\u201d a Federal law.</p>\n    </footnote>\n    <footnote label=\"2\">\n      <p id=\"Asg\"> California amended its interpleader statute in 1955 to allow the award of costs and reasonable attorney fees to the stakeholder. See: California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 386.6.</p>\n    </footnote>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}

Mr. Klitzkie appeared on behalf of the plaintiff and Mr. Manibusan represented the defendant. The motion was heard before the Honorable Paul J. Abbate on July 16, 1979, and decision was reserved.</p>\n    <p id=\"b672-13\">The plaintiff seeks summary judgment on an action to recover a sum of $3,507.75 from the defendant. The above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>sum was allegedly incurred and charged to the defendant\u2019s RCA account number. The basis for the plaintiff\u2019s action are records of the calls, supported by the affidavit from the plaintiff\u2019s credit administrator.</p>\n    <p id=\"b673-3\">The defendant denies any responsibility for the above-mentioned charges. Also, the defendant contends that the plaintiff was negligent in allowing such an amount to accrue since the credit limit on the defendant\u2019s RCA account is only $150.00.</p>\n    <p id=\"b673-4\">Before turning to the question of the existence of any genuine material issue of fact we must examine the records and supporting affidavit submitted by the plaintiff in support of summary judgment.</p>\n    <p id=\"b673-5\">In order to be admissible as evidence the records in question must fall into the business records exception to the hearsay rule. In order to fall within the above-mentioned exception certain requirements must generally be met. There are a line of California cases which list the basic elements which must be laid for a proper foundation. That would allow the business records to be admissible into evidence. The requirements are as follows:</p>\n    <p id=\"b673-6\">(1) that the books or records are kept in the regular course of business;</p>\n    <p id=\"b673-7\">(2) that the business is of a character in which it is proper and customary to keep such books;</p>\n    <p id=\"b673-8\">(3) that they were made at the time or within a reasonable proximity to the time of the transactions;</p>\n    <p id=\"b673-9\">(4) that the entries are either original entries or the first permanent entries of the transaction; and</p>\n    <p id=\"b673-10\">(5) that the persons making them had personal knowledge of the transaction or obtained such knowledge from a report regularly made to him by some person employed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>the business whose duty it was to make the same in the regular course of business; or the sources of information and method and time of preparation were such as to indicate its trustworthiness. <em>Gough v. Security Trust &amp; Savings Bank, </em>162 C.A.2d 90 (1958); <em>Kains v. First National Bank, </em>30 C.A. 447 (1939); <em>Richmond v. Frederick, </em>116 C.A.2d 541 (1953); <em>Bufono v. City and County of San Francisco, </em>233 C.A.2d 61 (1965); <em>Burke v. John E. Marshall, Inc., </em>42 C.A.2d 195 (1941); <em>Chan Kiu Sing v. Gordon, 171 </em>Cal. 28 (1915).</p>\n    <p id=\"b674-5\">Efforts to enter business records into evidence without laying a proper foundation will render those records incompetent and therefore inadmissible. <em>Pruett v. Burr, </em>257 P.2d 690 (1953); <em>Pabst Brewing Co. v. E. Clemens Horst Co., </em>229 F. 913 (1916).</p>\n    <p id=\"b674-6\">In the present case the plaintiff has failed to lay a sufficient foundation. The affidavit of one Beverly Bushaw does not fulfill the above-mentioned requirements for a proper foundation.</p>\n    <p id=\"b674-7\">Even though the records in question were to be found admissible a summary judgment would be improper for the reason that genuine material issues of fact do exist in this case and accordingly must be litigated at trial.</p>\n    <p id=\"b674-8\">For the aforementioned reasons, the plaintiff\u2019s MOTION IS DENIED.</p>\n    <p id=\"b674-9\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n  </opinion>\n</casebody>\n", "status": "ok"}}
